     A Christmas card vista is spoiled by a black line of
     railroad tracks stitched onto the snowy landscape like a
     scar pointing north to icy desolation. A phone rings -

</b>     An elderly man who lives alone in this rustic cabin -
     a retired policeman - regards the phone, both expecting
     and dreading the call. He picks up the receiver.

</b>
     Henrik Vanger - at 82, even older than Morell - listens
     to the silence from his end of the line in a wood-paneled
     room as baronial as the policeman's was spartan.
<b>                             VANGER
</b>               I can't take it anymore.
<b>                             MORELL O/S
</b>               I know. I'm sorry, Henrik.

     There's nothing more to say. Vanger sets the receiver
     down and regards a dried white flower in a 6" x 11" frame
     resting on the brown paper it was wrapped and mailed in.
     It's somehow ominous, like the dark storm clouds that now
     burst outside -
<b>                                                             2.

     Mikael Blomkvist - 40's - regards the gauntlet of
     reporters he'll have to pass to get out of the building.
     As he strides toward them, microphones and cameras swing
     in his direction. Without stopping -

<b>                             BLOMKVIST
</b>               What is this, the media event of the
               year?
<b>                             REPORTER 1
</b>               Don't try to play it down, Mikael, it
               won't work.

<b>                             BLOMKVIST
</b>               Don't try to play it up, that won't
               either.

</b>
     Feeling a bit like he's fleeing the scene of a crime,
     which in a way he is, Blomkvist steps outside opening his
     umbrella. A couple of the reporters come out after him -

<b>                             REPORTER 2
</b>               Will you appeal?
<b>                             BLOMKVIST
</b>               I'll appeal to you, Viggo:   Find a
               real story to cover.
     He hurries off in the rain.

<b>                             NEWSCASTER V/O
</b>               Financial journalist Mikael Blomkvist
               was found guilty today on 16 counts
               of aggravated libel against financier
               Hans-Erik Wennerstrom.

<b>5    INT. CAFE - STOCKHOLM - DAY                                   5
</b>
     At a table with a pre-made sandwich and cup of coffee,
     and a long court judgement, Blomkvist watches himself
     fleeing the reporters on the cafe's TV. He's the only
     one there who watches it - no one else is interested -
     which only makes it worse.
<b>                                                            3.
</b><b>                                                             3.
</b>    

<b>                            TV NEWSCASTER
</b>              In an article published earlier
              this year, Blomkvist claimed
              Wennerstrom - founder and president
              of The Wennerstrom Group - used State
              funds intended for industrial
              development in Poland for an arms
              deal with the right-wing Ustashe in
              Croatia.

    The report cuts to a shot of Wennerstrom outside the
    courthouse in an Armani suit, surrounded by his legal
    team, confidently addressing the reporters -

<b>                            WENNERSTROM ON TV
</b>              I have nothing against Mr.
              Blomkvist. He's a good journalist
              who I don't believe is guided by
              malice. But what he wrote was
              inaccurate, and inaccuracies can't go
              unanswered. He - all journalists -
              have to accept like the rest of us,
              actions have consequences.

    Done with his sandwich, Blomkvist goes to the counter.
<b>                            BLOMKVIST
</b>              Marlboro Red ... and a lighter.

    He comes out tamping the pack. Extracts a cigarette.
    Tosses the pack in a sidewalk trash bin. Flicks at the
    lighter but can't get it to fire in the wind and rain.
    Hunches his body around it, coaxes it to life.

<b>                            TV NEWSCASTER V/O
</b>              Blomkvist was ordered to pay 600
              thousand SKE in damages and all court
              costs, which could be significantly
              more.

    He takes a long drag that dizzies him. A wonderful
    feeling. He regards the trash bin. Fishes around it,
    finds the pack, puts it in his coat pocket.

    He comes through past Christmas decorations and a mostly-
    young staff. They try not to regard him as a dead-man-
    walking, but aren't entirely successful. He enters the
    editor's office.

Erika Berger is about Blomkvist's age, and - like the
IKEA furniture - sends a mixed message: a feminist in a
mini-skirt.

He sits, exhausted and depressed, in a cheap Poang chair.

</b>          You've been on the phone all day
          then.

<b>                        ERIKA
</b>          I'm as much to blame for this as you.

<b>                          BLOMKVIST

<b>                          ERIKA

<b>                          BLOMKVIST
</b>          Not the same.
<b>                        ERIKA

<b>                          BLOMKVIST
</b>          Mine is.
They regard each other in another silence.      Then -
<b>                                                             5.

<b>                             BLOMKVIST

               under a duvet and sleeping for a
               week.

     He thinks about it ... shakes his head `no.'

     Dragan Armansky, 40's, who looks more like a boss of a
     New Jersey crime family than CEO of a high-tech security
     firm, sits behind his desk, waiting with an older client.

<b>                             ARMANSKY
</b>               It's possible we could wait forever.
<b>                             FRODE
</b>               You called her, I thought.     You spoke
               to her.
<b>                             ARMANSKY
</b>               I'm afraid that doesn't mean much.

<b>                             FRODE
</b>               I don't understand.

<b>                             ARMANSKY
</b>               No one here likes her. So it's
               better if she works at home.
<b>                             FRODE
</b>               But you told her I wanted to meet
               her.

<b>                             ARMANSKY

               from her report -

     The report on Armansky's desk is 200 pages long.

     Armansky breathes a defeated sigh, taps the intercom
     button twice to say `okay, let her in.'

     Lisbeth Salander walks in: A small, pale, anorexic-
     looking waif in her early 20's. Short black-dyed hair -
     pierced eyelid - tattoo of a wasp on her neck; probably
     several more under her black leather jacket - black t-
     shirt, black jeans, black Caterpillar boots.

     Frode is only middlingly successful in concealing his
     initial reaction to her. This isn't punk fashion. This
     is someone saying, Stay the fuck away from me.

<b>                             ARMANSKY

She doesn't shake Frode's hand, but does address him:

<b>                        SALANDER
</b>          Something wrong with the report?
<b>                        FRODE
</b>          No. It seems quite thorough.
          There's a wealth of data here. But
          I'm also interested to know what's
          not in it.

<b>                        SALANDER
</b>          There's nothing not in it.

<b>                        FRODE
</b>          Your opinion of him isn't.

<b>                        SALANDER
</b>          I'm not paid to give my opinion.

<b>                        FRODE
</b>          So you don't have one?

Salander sends Armansky a weary look. His look back
begs her not to say anything unpleasant. Eventually -
<b>                         SALANDER
</b>          He's clean.   In my opinion.

<b>                        FRODE
</b>          He's - excuse me?

<b>                        SALANDER
</b>          He's honest. He's who he presents
          himself to be. In his business,
          that's an asset.

<b>                        FRODE
</b>          There's less in his asset column
          after his conviction today.
<b>                        SALANDER
</b>          That's true. He made a fool of
          himself with that. If it happened
          that way.
Frode looks at Armansky.    What's that supposed to mean?

<b>                        SALANDER
</b>          If he made up the story, that's
          out of character. So is giving up
          without a fight. People don't do
          things that are out of character.

<b>                        FRODE
</b>          Are you saying he was set up?

</b>

<b>                        SALANDER
</b>          That wasn't part of my assignment.

And, apparently, she has no opinion on it either.
<b>                        FRODE
</b>          You're quite right he made a fool of
          himself professionally. How big of a
          fool did he make of himself
          financially?

<b>                        SALANDER
</b>          The judgement will just about empty
          his savings.
This seems to please Frode more than anything else that
has been said, and Salander sees it.
<b>                        SALANDER
</b>          May I go?

<b>                        FRODE
</b>          Your report is light in another

          you chose not to include?
<b>                        SALANDER

</b>          I think what Ms. Salander means, and
          I agree, is that everyone has a right
          to a certain amount of privacy, even
          when they're being investigated.

          if there's anything about him I might
          find unsavory - even if she doesn't.

Armansky's look to her at once apologizes for Frode, and
encourages her to speak. She finally relents but puts no
more spin on it than any other piece of raw data -

          with his co-editor. It wrecked his
          marriage, but not hers. Her husband
          accepts it. Sometimes she sleeps at
          Blomkvist's, sometimes at home.

Frode thinks about that, perhaps imagining how much
simpler his own life would be with such an arrangement.

      to a stately manor. As Frode and Blomkvist climb out, a
      distant gunshot echoes, but neither Frode nor the old man
      who appears at the front door of the manor pays it any
      attention; just someone hunting.

               later. For now, hot tea is waiting.

           Richard died a martyr to the Nazi
           cause in 1940 - missed all the real
           excitement - but not the opportunity
           to regularly beat his wife Margareta

      Vanger considers an empty chair as everyone else,
      including the young man from the bridge, his jacket
      draped on his chair, passes platters of food around.

      fresh-killed and cooked duck they've been eating. It and
      the mention of Wennerstrom's name clouds, at least for a
      moment, Blomkvist's memory of the train he missed.

      couldn't be more different than Wennerstrom's. Knocks
      on a door, waits, listens to some dead-bolts unlocking.

      It opens, but remains impassable by a figure weighing
      over 300 pounds. He offers her no greeting. Fades back
      into the shadows of his dark apartment.

      She reaches to take the money back, but he pockets it and
      moves across the dark room to a work table where high-end
      computers fight for space with debris. Finds and gives
      her a small homemade electronic box, which she turns over
      in her hands.

     on his doorstep with a handcart loaded with file boxes.

     Vanger has ventured outside to show Blomkvist around
     the estate. Smoke from chimneys rise into bitter cold
     grey skies, weather for which Blomkvist, unlike the old
     man, is inadequately dressed.

<b>                             VANGER
</b>               The island is owned by my family.
               Your closest neighbor is my brother
               Harald, another Nazi if you can
               believe. Two in the family. He's
               detestable to put it nicely, but
               you'll probably never see him. He's
               a recluse.

<b>                             BLOMKVIST

<b>                             VANGER
</b>               Indeed he was.

     Vanger's look to Blomkvist adds, `so consider him a
     suspect.' He indicates another house on the grounds -
<b>                             VANGER
</b>               That's his daughter Cecilia's house.
               They don't speak.

<b>                             BLOMKVIST
</b>               Does anyone speak to anyone on this

</b>          I'm quickly losing track who's who.

</b>          Oh, how you'll wish were it always
          so. Soon you'll know us all only too
          well - with my apologies.
               (points)
          Out there is my nephew Martin's
          house; Harriet's brother.

It's a modern house - lots of glass - out on the point.

<b>                        BLOMKVIST
</b>          Who speaks to him?
<b>                        VANGER
</b>          I speak to him. He runs the company
          now, as I think I told you.

They hear a distant rifle crack and echo.     It startles
Blomkvist a bit, but not Vanger.

<b>                        VANGER
</b>          Someone shooting their dinner.
          Gunner probably. The caretaker.
<b>                        BLOMKVIST
</b>          I just met him.
<b>                        VANGER
</b>          He was 19 when Harriet disappeared.

Old enough, Blomkvist gathers, to be considered a
suspect. Vanger points off -
<b>                        VANGER
</b>          He lives over there.

Shivering in the cold, Blomkvist turns.
<b>                        BLOMKVIST
</b>          And you live here.

<b>                        VANGER

Then he is, and is pleased by it.

Morell nods that he knows that only too well as he turns
to that last page. On it, in neat handwriting:

</b>          They're local Hedestad phone numbers.
          The first belonged to a woman named
          Margot, whose mother was Magda, who
          claimed she didn't know Harriet. The
          fourth, R.L., belonged to Rosemarie
          Larsson, an elderly woman who died a
          few years before. The other three
          were unconnected in any way that I
          could find.
He hands the address book back. It, and everything else
about the case, clearly trouble him still.

          rather forget. I'm sorry.

<b>                        MORELL
</b>          I can't forget it. It's my Rebecka
          Case.

Blomkvist isn't sure what that means.

<b>                        MORELL
</b>          Every policeman has at least one
          unsolved case. Back then it was old
          Torstensson. Year after year he kept
          returning to one - taking out the
          files - uselessly studying them. As
          young men, we had to laugh.
<b>                        BLOMKVIST
</b>          Was this also a missing girl case?

<b>                             MORELL
</b>               No, that's not why I mention it.
               The Rebecka Case is something that
               happened before Harriet was born.
               I'm talking about the soul of a
               policeman. Poor Torstensson could
               never solve it, and could never let
               it go.
     And neither can poor Morell with his Harriet case.

     As a man behind a desk reviews   a thick file, Salander
     reviews him: About 50; spends    money on suits, thinking

          for intoxication, twice for narcotics
          use, and most recently for assault:

      Martin's house didn't look so far away, but the road

     The place is far cry from Vanger's manor. It's modern.
     Martin, Liv and Blomkvist work on the dinner Martin has

     They all glance away to a sound: A soft, strange,
     wailing wind. Martin drains the last of a bottle of wine
     in Blomkvist's glass and gets up.

          Anything else is fine. Harriet

          have about half that now, and that
          downward slide - anyone can tell you -
          began after my sister's death. It
          broke Henrik's entrepreneurial
          spirit, and his heart.

     As Salander moves with a crowd toward the doors of a
     subway car, someone behind her roughly yanks the strap of
     her messenger bag from her shoulder -
     She gives chase, pushes past people, catches up with the
     junkie, grapples with him. He slugs her. She goes down,
     but doesn't give up. Catches up with him on the
     escalator, throws him back down it. The bag slams onto
     the metal stairs, too, but at least she has it now.

     She doesn't run. She waits at the top and watches the
     junkie drag himself up and think about trying again. He
     wisely decides to let it go, hops to the down-escalator
     and disappears into the underground station.

     Blomkvist sifts through a box containing some of
     Harriet's personal belongings: school papers, textbooks,
     a Bible, the address book, her wallet and ID ...

     A knock on the door. He puts the box in a closet on top
     of others, kicks it closed, opens the front door to find
     a not unattractive woman in her 50's on his porch.

               be putting on makeup and wearing the

               The next she'd be studying a Bible
               like a nun - no Vanger was ever
               religious - can you imagine?

               I got out of there when I was 18 and
               never went back. She would have done
               the same but didn't make it to 18.

       He walks to the hallway. She doesn't. He holds out
       his hand. She finally joins him. As they step into the

       a handcuff around the wrist. He quickly cuffs the other

       the headboard posts, her ankles secured to the foot posts
       with silk ties, and scissors slicing her jeans off. She
       starts to scream and he stuffs her mouth with her

       of her. She keeps fighting but there's not much she can
       do handcuffed. Eventually, she retreats to another place
       inside herself. She's had to go here before in her life;

       The cat turns its head to a sound Blomkvist can't hear.
       He has Harriet's box of belongings out again and looks at
       photos of her school friends in her wallet. Then picks
       up the Bible. Handwritten on the inside cover is Harriet
       Vanger. He opens it at random. Hebrews:

                 seen. Through faith we understand
                 that the world was created by the
                 word of God - and that what is seen
                 was not made of things that are
                 visible ...

       It's bizarre: his manner seems to be one of genuine
       concern. She nods. He hands her the check. Then opens
       the door for her like a perfect gentleman.

           I feel bad that I've take Mikael
           away from you at the worst possible
           time. This is the right thing to do.
           The moral thing. That's one reason.
