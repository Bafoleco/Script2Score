<b>                      DEAGOL
</b>           Why?

CLOSE ON: SMEAGOL moves towards DEAGOL . . .

<b>                     SMEAGOL

IMAGES: SMEAGOL descending into madness. His body TWISTS and
DISTORTS . . . he becomes a CREEPY, SHRIVELLED wretch . . . finally
crawling into a DARK CAVE beneath the MISTY MOUNTAINS.

<b>                     SMEAGOL V/0

             And we wept, Precious, we wept to be so
             alone. And we forgot the taste of bread,
             the sound of trees, the softness of the
             wind . . . We even forgot our own name.
                  (in a choking cough)
             Gollum! Gollum!

ANGLE ON: GOLLUM in the CAVE staring at the RING in his hand.

towards the MOUNTAINS.

SETTLE ON: FRODO and SAM in a FILTHY CULVERT.
SAM twitches in a RESTLESS SLEEP. But FRODO is awake . . . His
hand trails down to the CHAIN around his NECK ...

A SUDDEN HISS! FRODO quickly hides the RING as GOLLUM peers
at them with GLEAMING EYES.

<b>                        GOLLUM
</b>             Wake up! Wake up! Wake up, sleepies! We

<b>                        SAM

</b>             No . . . no it isn't. It isn't midday yet.
             The days are growing darker.

The GROUND suddenly QUIVERS, as a ROLLING, RUMBLING NOISE
ECHOES down the VALLEY.

<b>                        GOLLUM

<b>                        SAM

<b>                        GOLLUM
</b>             . . . no time to lose, silly.

SAM shoots GOLLUM a HOSTILE LOOK and turns back to rummage in
his KNAPSACK. He holds up a piece of dried LEMBAS BREAD to
<b>FRODO.

<b>                        SAM

            I've rationed it. There should be enough.

FRODO looksa t SAM questioningly.

<b>                       SAM

FRODO says nothing.                                            .

GANDALF leads ARAGORN, LEGOLAS, THEODEN and GIMLI through
dark woodland . . .

The MOVING FOREST of FANGORN ...opens before them . . .

Far off, half veiled int he swirling STEAM, the TOWER of
ORTHANC stands ... Unbroken by the storm. Pale waters lap
about its feet.

ANGLE ON: TWO SMALL HOBBITS are sitting on the SMASHED WALL
. . . MERRY and PIPPIN! SPREAD before them is a feast of
BREADS, MEATS and WINE. They PUFF on long pipes as they lie
back in the SUN.

<b>                       PIPPIN

jetsam which floats upon the muddied waters surrounding the
TOWER ... TREEBEARD, the GIANT ENT, strides towards them,

           Trees will come back to live here, young
           trees . . . wild trees.

FRODO beckons to GOLLUM.

                      FRODO (cont'd)

GOLLUM turns slowly, staring at SAM through hooded, HATE-FILLED

ARAGORN joins LEGOLAS on the STEPS to the GOLDEN HALL, oblivious

PIPPIN gasps with FRIGHT! MERRY is sitting up, wiping sleep
from his eyes. He moves on . . .

ANGLE ON: A sleeping GANDALF lies with eyes wide open! But
PIPPIN is undeterred . . .

MERRY sits up, a worried look on his face.

                       MERRY (cont'd)
             Pippin? Pippin? Pippin! What are you doing?

With quick stealth, PIPPIN lifts the WRAPPED PALANTIR from

PIPPIN unwraps the PALANTIR and as MERRY looks on HORRIFIED,
he gazes INTENTLY into it.

                       MERRY (cont'd)

As PIPPIN lays his hands on the CRYSTAL, a SICKLY PALE light

<b>INT. EDORAS, SLEEPING QUARTERS - NIGHT
</b>
PIPPIN suddenly starts to HYPERVENTILATE . . . He STAGGERS
BACKWARDS, PALANTIR held rigidly before him . . .

THE GREAT EYE OF SAURON seems to LEAP from the FIRE . . . PIPPIN
is bathed in the FIERY RED LIGHT.

PIPPIN sinks to his KNEES, his mouth open in a soundless SCREAM
. . . He FALLS BACKWARDS, powerless to release the FIERY GLOBE.

<b>                        MERRY

GANDALF wakes with a start! Just as ARAGORN enters, and
wrenches the PALANTIR from PIPPIN'S HANDS . . . PIPPIN FALLS to
the FLOOR! . . . ARAGORN spins away, reeling backwards, the
PALANTIR falling from his HANDS . . .

The PALANTIR rolls across the FLOOR, causing EVERYONE in the
room to COWER BACK.                                    ;

GANDALF turns to look at THEODEN.

                        GANDALF (cont'd)
             We've been strangely fortunate. What Pippin
             saw in the Palantir was a glimpse of our
             enemy's plan.

GANDALF looks from on to the other of the, gathered company.

                       GANDALF (cont'd)
             Sauron moves to strike the city of Minas
             Tirith. His defeat at Helm's Deep showed
             our enemy one thing.

The WIZARD turns towards ARAGORN . . .

                        GANDALF (cont'd)
             The heir of Elendil has come forth. Men are
             not as weak as he supposed. There is
             courage still - strength enough left to
             challenge him.

THEODEN listens intently, saying nothing.

A SILHOUETTED FIGURE appears in the distance and moves
towards the CHILD . . . the BOY runs to the FIGURE.

its tall WHITE FACE whitening in the RISING SUN. Upon its out-
thrust knee is the Guarded City: MINAS TIRITH.

With SEVEN WALLS OF WHITE STONE, so strong and old that it
seems to have been not built, MINAS TIRITH looks carven by
giants out of the bones of the earth.

AERIAL SHOT: SHADOWFAX, carrying GANDALF and PIPPIN up
towards the 7th LEVEL.

MINAS TIRITH is built in 7 LEVELS - each behind a CIRCULAR
DEFENSIVE WALL. Each level rises - the city reaches a height
of nearly 1000 FEET on its TOPMOST LEVEL.

A towering BASTION of NATURAL ROCK - shaped like a sharp
ship's prow - bisects the city from the 2nd LEVEL to the TOP.

SHADOWFAX arrives at a GREAT CITADEL on the SUMMIT of the

self-deprecating smile . . .

ANGLE ON: MINAS MORGUL, a MASSIVE DEAD CITY, set upon a ROCKY
KNEE at the HEAD OF THE morgul valley. CORRUPT and LOATHSOME,
it glows with a SICKLY LUMINOUS LIGHT - like a CORPSE CANDLE.

TWO HUGE, BESTIAL STONE STATUES guard the BRIDGE that leads

FRODO falls to the GROUND.

AT THAT MOMENT: the GROUND QUIVERS, and a great RUMBLING
NOISE rolls across the ground and ECHOES in the mountains.

The cold, dull MORGUL VALLEY is suddenly VIOLENT and FIERCE,

AERIAL SHOT: . . . HIGH above MINAS MORGUL, on the SMALL LEDGE
next to the STAIRS, LIE the FIGURES of FRODO, SAM and GOLLUM.

SAM watches a sleeping GOLLUM suspiciously as he desperately
tries to stay awake. SLOWLY, INEVITABLY, SAM, falls asleep.

CLOSE ON: GOLLUM'S EYES SNAP OPEN . . . he sits up and quietly
crawls towards SAM'S KNAPSACK.

SAM breathes deeply now, heavily asleep.

GOLLUM grimaces in DISTASTE as he pulls out the LEMBAS BREAD
. .. Quietly he SPRINKLES CRUMBS over the sleeping SAM.

ANGLE ON: GOLLUM as he throws the remaining LEMBAS BREAD over
the cliff.

CLOSE ON: SAM'S EYES flick open . . . GOLLUM spins around,
caught off guard . . .

             Sneaking? Sneaking? Fat Hobbit is always so

             nobody else could find and they say

</b>             None who venture there ever return.
                  (under his breath)
             That mountain is evil . . .

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN stands before the road as though transfixed
... before him a HORSE whinnies and pulls at his ropes
nervously . . .

ARAGORN POV: A GHOSTLY FIGURE seems to emerge from the gloom
... ARAGORN starts in fright as . . .

<b>                        GIMLI O.S
</b>             Aragorn!

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN stares down at the LITTLE DWARF . . .

<b>                        GIMLI
</b>             Let's find some food.

ARAGORN casts another look back at the ANCIENT STANDING
STONES before following GIMLI.

<b>EXT. DUNHARROW PLATEAU - DUSK
</b>
ANGLE ON: All is quiet in the ENCAMPMENT...

<b>INT. EOWYN'S TENT, DUNHARROW - NIGHT
</b>
ANGLE ON: EOWYN kneels before MERRY, adjusting his HELMET
<b>STRAP.
</b>
<b>                        EOWYN
</b>             There! A true Esquire of Rohan.

MERRY exhales - excited and terrified in equal measure. In
his EXCITEMENT, he draws his SWORD ...

EOWYN steps back, laughing ...

<b>                        MERRY
</b>             Sorry. It isn't all that dangerous.
                  (despondent)
             It isn't even sharp.

<b>                       EOWYN
</b>             Well, that's no good. You won't kill many
             Ores with a blunt blade. Come on.

<b>EXT. DUNHARROW PLATEAU - NIGHT
</b>
As EOWYN and MERRY leave the tent, EOMER and GAMLING are
sitting nearby, finishing a meal ... EOWYN ushers MERRY off.

<b>                        EOWYN
</b>             To the Smithy .- go!

MERRY hurries off    . . . EOMER watches the YOUNG HOBBIT leave.

<b>                        EOMER
</b>             You should not encourage him.

<b>                        EOWYN
</b>             And you should not doubt him.

<b>                        EOMER
</b>             I do not doubt his heart ... Only the reach
             of his arm.

CLOSE ON: GAMLING stifles a laugh . . . EOWYN turns on both of
te .. .
 hm                                                      .

<b>                        EOWYN
</b>             Why should Merry be left behind? He has as
             much cause to go to war as you.
                  (to herself)
             Why can he not fight for those he loves?

ANGLE ON: At the PLATEAU edge, a GUARD looks down the STEEP
PRECIPICE as a HORSE and RIDER move along the RIDGE ...

<b>EXT. DUNHARROW TRACK - NIGHT
</b>
ANGLES ON: The HOODED FIGURE slowly RIDES up the NARROW ZIG-
ZAG TRACK leading up to the PLATEAU ...

<b>INT. ARAGORN'S TENT, DUNHARROW - NIGHT
</b>
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN tosses in his SLEEP, disturbed by images
and voices . . .

<b>                        GANDALF V/0
</b>             Look to the Black Ships . . .

In ARAGORN'S dream ARWEN suddenly WAKES ...

<b>                        ARWEN V/0
</b>             I choose a mortal life . . . I wish I could
             have seen him, one last time ...

As ARWEN lies dying, the EVENSTAR falls from her fingers ...
At that moment, ARAGORN wakes, his SWORD quickly in his HAND
. . . A GUARD stands in the DOORWAY ...

<b>                        GUARD
</b>             King Theoden awaits you, my Lord.

<b>EXT. DUNHARROW PLATEAU - NIGHT
</b>
ARAGORN hurries towards THEODEN'S TENT ...

<b>INT. THEODEN'S TENT, DUNHARROW PLATEAU - NIGHT
</b>
ANGLE ON:- THEODEN looks up as ARAGORN enters.

<b>                       THEODEN
</b>             I take my leave.

ANGLE ON: THEODEN bows slightly to the HOODED FIGURE and
LEAVES, shooting ARAGORN a strange look as he goes ...

CLOSE ON: The FIGURE stands and pulls back the HOOD . . . to
reveal ... ELROND.

<b>                    ARAGORN
</b>          My Lord, Elrond.

<b>                       ELROND
</b>             I come on behalf of one whom I love.

ELROND'S face is ETCHED with PAIN ...

                    ELROND (cont'd)
          Arwen is dying.

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN receiving this news ... ASHEN-FACED.

<b>                        ARAGORN
</b>             She stayed?

<b>                       ELROND
</b>             She will not long survive the evil that now
             spreads from Mordor.

ELROND'S eyes fall to the EVENSTAR which hangs around
ARAGORN'S neck . . .

                        ELROND (cont'd)
             The light of the Evenstar is failing. As
             Sauron's power grows, her strength wanes.
             Arwen's life is now tied to the fate of the
             Ring. The Shadow is upon us, Aragorn, the
             end has come.

<b>                       ARAGORN
</b>             It will not be our end, but his.

<b>                         ELROND
</b>             You ride to war, but not to victory.
             Sauron's armies march on Minas Tirith -
             this you know - but in secret he sends
             another force which will attack from the
             river . . .

CLOSE ON: ARAGORN looks at ELROND in shock.

                       ELROND (cont'd)
             A fleet of Corsair ships sails from the
             South.

FLASH INSERT: A FLEET of BLACK SAILS moving along a SILVER
RIBBON of WATER .

                        ELROND (cont'd)
             They will be in the city in two days . . .
             You're out-numbered, Aragorn. You need more
             men.

<b>                        ARAGORN
</b>             There are none.

ELROND hesitates a BEAT ...

<b>                      ELROND
</b>                (quietly)
           There are those who dwell in the mountain.

A SUDDEN WIND rushes through the TENT, lifting HANGINGS,
scattering MAPS, knocking over GOBLETS . . .

As ARAGORN looks at ELROND, an IMAGE FLASHES in his MIND'S
EYE . . . The GHOSTLY FIGURE on the DIMHOLT ROAD . . .

ARAGORN looks at ELROND in shock . . .

<b>                    ARAGORN
</b>          Murderers, traitors - you would call upon
          them to fight? They believe in nothing.
          They answer to no-one.

<b>                     ELROND
</b>          They will answer to the King of Condor.

ARAGORN' S eyes fall to a PLAIN BLACK SCABBARD, which ELROND
draws from beneath his robes.

CLOSE ON: ELROND' S long white fingers draw the hilt of a
SWORD from the scabbard to reveal . . . a ELVEN SWORD glints in
the firelight!

                     ELROND (cont'd)
          Anduril, flame of the West . . . forged from
          the shards of Narsil.

ARAGORN takes the sword . . . staring at it in wonder.

<b>                        ARAGORN
</b>          Sauron will not have forgotten the sword of
          Elendil . . .

ARAGORN draws the long blade from its sheath . . .

                     A RAG OR N (c on t' d)
          . . . the blade that was broken shall return
          to Minas Tirith.

<b>                      ELROND
</b>            The man who can wield the power of this
            sword can summon to him an army more deadly
            than any that walks this earth.

ELROND stares hard at ARAGORN . . .

                      ELROND (cont'd)
            Put aside the Ranger - become who you were
            born to be - take the Dimhplt Road.

A HEAVY SILENCE hangs in the room.

                         ELROND (cont'd)
                  (ELVISH: with subtitles)
