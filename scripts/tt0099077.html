</b> 1. A dusty deserted street - saloon, livery stable, sunset.
 Only there is something unsettling about it all. The colors
 are too muted and the angles not quite in perspective. Pulling
slowly back eventually reveals the edges of a narrow wooden
picture frame ...

<b>INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT - 1930
</b>Drifting away from the painting and slowly across a room.
Across Venetian blinds, open, letting in moonlight, across
intricate handmade wooden models, dime novels and comic books,
across the arm of a metronome gently slapping back and forth,
and settling finally on a small hand writing slowly and
deliberately, over and over, in synchronization, it seems, to
the rhythm of the metronome, the word, " L E O N A R D . "

<b>2.   INT. DINING ROOM - MORNING - 1930
</b>The pendulum of a clock. An adult hand placing a bowl of
cereal on a table. Leonard, ten or eleven, waits a moment for
the adult to leave, grasps his spoon, and manipulates it from
bowl to mouth in time with the soft regular rhythm of the
clock.

<b>3.   EXT. STREET - NEW YORK - MORNING - 1930                      3.
</b>Schoolbooks slung over their shoulders, Leonard and another boy
his age, a classmate, move along a street.
All around them are "visual rhythms" - lines in the sidewalk,
the even placement of trees, the sunlight breaking through the
branches above them - and somewhere unseen, the rhythmic
pounding of an elevator train.
As they climb a fence, a pocket watch, Leonard's, falls to the
ground.

<b>                                                                  4.
</b><b>4.   INT. CLASSROOM - DAY - 1930
</b>An adult hand chalking the words of a poem on a blackboard.
Children at desks dutifully transcribing the lesson.
All but one. Leonard. Whose hands are trembling slightly and
whose paper is blank. There is a noticeable lack of rhythms.
A cold silence. The broken watch rests on his desk.
The boy from the train, glancing at Leonard, begins gently
tapping the end of his pen against his desk. Leonard, "guided"
by the cadence of his friend's tapping, begins to write.
<b>
</b>(o   The teacher's hand at the blackboard hesitates. Distracted by     4.
     the rhythmic noise, he traces it to the offender and silences
     him with a look.
<b>                            \      '
</b>     Without the rhythm, and without, apparently, inner natural
     rhythms to replace it, Leonard's hand begins dragging the pen
     across the paper, forming vague scrawl, each word less defined
     than the last, until they begin melding together into what
     resembles nothing so much as a child's rendering of ocean
     waves.
     The teacher resumes chalking on the board. The boy from the
     train begins tapping his pen again, and, "guided" again by the
     rhythm, Leonard is able to give definition to the "ocean
     waves," to form recognizable letters.and words.
     The teacher hesitates again and glares at the boy making the
     irritating noise. The boy stops tapping and Leonard's writing
     again becomes formless.

<b>                                                                       5.
</b><b>     5. INT. CLASSROOM.- LATER - DAY - 1930
</b>     The finished poem on the blackboard. The sounds of children at
     play on the schoolyard. The teacher, alone in the classroom,

o    at his desk grading the penmanship lesson.
     He circles offending errors on the last page of the last
     composition book. He scribbles a grade opposite the student's
     name in a grade book. He notices the absence of a grade in
     Leonard's column.                         .
     Leonard's desk. The teacher locates the missing composition
     book buried under textbooks. He takes it back to his own desk,
     opens it, and stares curiously at the last lesson, the poem, or
     rather Leonard's illegible representation of it.
     He considers earlier lessons in the book. He begins to see in
     the script a pattern of deterioration. He reaches the last
     entry again and stares at the few recognizable words drowning
     In "the waves."

</b><b>     6.   INT. LEONARD'S BEDROOM - DAY - 1930 - WINTER
</b>     The painting on the wall. The intricate wooden models and dime
     novels. The Venetian blinds, closed, shutting out sunlight.
     Voices, barely audible, from somewhere else in the house:
<b>                          BOY'S VOICE
</b>                When can I see him?
<b>                          WOMAN'S VOICE
</b>                When he's well.

After a moment --
<b>                     WOMAN'S VOICE
</b>           I don't know.
-- and the sound of a door closing.
A small twisted hand lifts a slat of the Venetian blinds
revealing the snow-patched street below. Leonard's friend,
crossing it, glances back . . . then disappears around a corner.
And the small gnarled hand lets the slat slide down,
extinguishing the single ray of light.

<b>                                             FADE TO BLACK

</b>Tight on the face of a man (SAYER), late thirties, glasses,
staring up at the face of a building, imposing in its
institutional dullness.

<b>6B.    INT. LOBBY - BAINBRIDGE - DAY                               6B.
</b>A dim, sleepy cavern of a lobby. No one but a switchboard
operator thumbing through a magazine. Echoing footsteps reach
her station and she glances up and at the man from outside.

<b>7.    INT. ADMINISTRATION OFFICE - BAINBRIDGE - DAY
</b>He seems uncomfortable. Perhaps it's the suit. Or the place.
Or the situation. Or the hard straight-backed chair he's in.
When he does finally speak, it's with great sincerity --

</b>           When you say people ... you mean
           living people,                 .
Behind an old oak desk, the hospital's Director glances over
to its Chief of Medicine, Dr. Kaufman, with a look that seems
to wonder, As opposed to what?
<b>                     DIRECTOR
</b>           Living people, yes.   Patients.

uncomfortable. He tries to clear up the confusion -

He doesn't laugh at Sayer, just at the thought of it.
<b>                    DIRECTOR
</b>          We have an x-ray room.
Sayer tries to share the Director's amusement with a good- *
natured smile, but doesn't really understand it. Kaufman seems *
to have less time for this, and in plain English, unadorned -  *

    The director offers a slow tentative nod before consulting the
    resume again.

    As the Director retreats back to the resume, hoping against
    hope of finding in it something germane, Sayer glances away to
    a window. He wishes he were outside it. He has no business
    being here. He should leave.

    director keeps searching the resume.

We have no choice. The Director gets up out of his chair, and,
smiling broadly, extends his hand to Sayer. Which unsettles
Sayer. Which in turn unsettles the Director.

     on the clipboard. Unsuccessful, he excuses himself from her
     and crosses the room to a nurse.

     The nurse turns away. Sayer crosses slowly back to Mrs. Cohen,
     trying to find the words to tell her. He doesn't have to; his
     discomfort does it. Her hand slowly reaches up and pulls the
     ribbon from her hair.

     containing medical instruments. A metal examination table with
     leather straps.
     Sayer alone at one of three old desks in the large room, still
     unsettled from the experience with Mrs. Cohen. Eventually, he
     gets up, crosses to a window and tries to open it.
     It's jammed shut, painted shut perhaps, but finally gives way,
     sliding up. He lets the air from outside wash over his face as
     he stares out absently at children on an elementary school
     playground beyond a debris-strewn field.

     Sayer turns to the voice, to Miss Costello, the hospital's head
     nurse, a veteran of this place, a woman who has seen it all.
     She's standing in the doorway.

Cold eggs and toast and prescription medicine on a kitchenette

broken cup. .
An old woman on her knees, eyes closed, arms tangled in an
aluminum walker, limp and stiff at once somehow, like the limbs
of a discarded marionette. Beyond her, beyond a threshold, a
shuttered living room. Furniture from another era and the
clutter of a lifetime.
A shadowy figure in a wicker wheelchair near the Victrola.
Another old woman, with spindly limbs, profoundly afflicted and
preposterously still. The back of her head is flat and bald,
the result of lying supine upon it for much of several decades.
On her passive face rest round wire-rim glasses. Insane or
retarded and unaware of the dead woman, she mumbles, just
barely audibly, a melody.

</b>Sayer reaches to her face and carefully pulls the glasses from
it. He cleans them with a flap of his lab coat -- they are
loose, bent out of shape*-- and gently slides the temples back
over her ears.
He turns away from her and types at a manual Underwood. The
form in the machine, at the top, reads -- BAINBRIDGE HOSPITAL /
ADMISSIONS / CONSULTATION REQUEST / NEUROLOGY. Sayer types in
a lower section headed -- FINDINGS / DIAGNOSIS.
He turns back in his chair to find the woman doubled-over in
her wheelchair, one arm very close to the floor, the hand
clutching the glasses. She is not moving, but she has moved.
That, or she is dead.
Sayer rights her, takes the glasses from her hand and slips
them back onto her face. He studies her for a moment, and for
that moment remains as still, as entranced, as her.
He takes the glasses from her face again and sets them on the
floor. He waits. She doesn't retrieve them. He picks them up
and holds them out to her. She doesn't move to take them. He
lets go of them and she lunges forward, catching them the
instant before they hit the floor. Sayer just stares.

Without any warning whatsoever Sayer tosses a tennis ball at
her. Her hand suddenly jerks up out of her lap and catches it.
And stays there, stiff, still.
Sayer is delighted but the expression on Kaufman's face is that
of one who has long ago learned and tired of simple card
tricks. Dismissing the phenomenon --�

Sayer, however, is unaware that he has caused any.

Sidney turns to a patient, an elderly woman in a wheelchair
beside him. Her state resembles that of Lucy's, that is, she
appears to have no awareness of Sidney, Sayer, or anything else
in her environment. It is only now, in fact, as Sidney spoons
soup into her mouth, careful not to spill any, that Sayer
notices her.

(P\   Borrows a section, returns with it, slides it under the pen and
       waits. The man doesn't write. Doesn't move.
      Sayer takes the pen back, returns it to his coat pocket,
      hesitates, pulls it out again, holds it out . . . and lets it go.
      The man, lightning quick, catches it.

      television set with a horizontal hold problem.
      Sayer drags a chair over, stands       on it, adjusts the set,
      corrects it, gets a picture . . .      but the man's "attention"
      slowly drifts away. Sayer "read       justs" it, gets the jumping
      horizontal lines again, and the       man's vacant eyes return.

      before a table, absolutely motionless, on thin bird-like legs.
      It is Lucy, the one who caught/the tennis ball. The movement
      of nurses and other patients only accentuates her stillness.
       Sayer considers her from all      angles as    one considers an
       abstract art piece that baff     les but in   trigues. Unlike the
      others, she's on her feet. A      nd unlike    the others, she seems,
      to Sayer, to have been headed      somewhere    before turning to stone
      again.

</b>      He decides that her destination was the drinking fountain
      across the room. And that it's the table, like a barrier, that
      has arrested her progress. He moves the table.
      In what appears to be slow motion, she takes a tiny step. And
      another. And another before encountering and being "blocked"
      by an empty wheelchair. She stops.
      Sayer moves the wheelchair and all other obstacles out of her
      path. She continues and eventually makes it halfway to the
      fountain before mysteriously stopping again.
      Sayer studies the puzzle ... there are no longer any barriers
      in her way, but she's not moving. Defeated, he goes to the
      fountain himself, fills a paper cup, and takes it to her.
      Across the room, a man in a wheelchair, another "ghost"
      (LEONARD), stares through eyes which seem more dead than alive.
      "At" Sayer.

    Boxes of ancient history have been dragged out of storage, the
    emphysema-plagued doctor's post-encephalitic research, files
    and photographs and cans of 16mm film.

               of the illness, during a sleep so
               deep they couldn't be roused. A
               sleep that in most cases lasted
               several months.
    The doctors, in the dark, watch forty year old footage
    projected onto a screen by a pre-World War II Bell &amp; Howell -
    a motionless man in a chair, his head thrust back, mouth gaping
    open, arms suspended out from an emaciated torso as if from
    invisible strings.

              ten, fifteen - before anyone
              suspected they were not well. .
              They were not.
    A doctor, this doctor decades younger, appears beside the
    subject on the screen and lowers the man's arms.
<b>                        OLD DOCTOR

              1930's - old people brought in by
              their children, young people
              brought in by their parents - all
              of them complaining they weren't
              "themselves" anymore. They'd
              grown distant, aloof, anti-social,
              they daydreamed at the dinner
              table. I referred them to
              psychiatrists.
    The man on the screen disappears and is replaced by a seal-
    shaped woman in whom a hundred strange diseases seem to reside.
    They conspire against her, torment and harass her, force her to
    perform incessant and meaningless actions with her hands, to
    paw her chin, to flutter, to adjust glasses that aren't there.

</b>Sayer has assembled them all, the fourteen or fifteen he has
decided are post-encephalitics, and wanders among them like a
naturalist in a garden of stone.
He lifts an arm of one particularly remote male patient.   It
remains suspended, doll-like.
He tries to follow the trajectory of another's gaze.   It leads
 only to blank space.
He considers another who appears "deeply involved" in some
minute and curious activity with his twisted hands, a kind of
tearing, shredding motion.

Across the room, paying no attention to Sayer, are Sidney and
Lolly. He's gently brushing her hair.
Sayer manages a pen into the hand of another woman and she
"draws" a kind a kind of circular shape that spirals in on
itself until it reaches a "vanishing point" in the center.

Sayer and Miss Costello, like visitors to a museum, consider
each for a moment before moving onto the next.
Printed in the left column of each are a circle, square,
triangle and daisy. In the right are the post-encephalitics'
failed "attempts" to copy them.

Sayer keeps coming back to one in particular. Unlike the
others which, if you use your imagination, vaguely correspond
somewhat positionally to the pre-printed shapes, this one bears
no resemblance. This patient has instead scrawled over the
shapes, seemingly violently.
Miss Costello joins Sayer and ponders it along with him.
Eventually, as if to excuse it and its maker--
<b>                     MISS COSTELLO
</b>           It's different.
<b>                      SAYER

Sayer keeps studying it.
<b>                    SAYER

          Did he fail to understand? Or was
          he unwilling to fail?
He isn't really asking her to answer, which is fine with her
since she doubts equally both hypotheses.
<b>                    SAYER

               (before she can
                respond:)
          Could it be willfully bad?
She doesn't say it but it's clear she thinks Sayer is reading
far too much into the "badness" of the patient's scrawl. To
himself -

She pictures the moment in her mind, and waits, it seems, for
the young Leonard to speak, to tell her what it is he wants.
Finally she lowers her arm and shrugs.

A circle of patients in wheelchairs. The post-encephalitics
reunited. "Waking" just long enough to catch and release the
object, a small beach ball.
Leonard and Sayer, on opposite sides of the circle, ignoring
the ball and the other patients. He's reached a dead end,
Sayer, right where he began, his only "accomplishment,"
this, ball-catching patients.

<b>50.   INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY                                   50.
</b>Sayer alone in the examination room, tired, at its window
staring blankly out.
His perspective: The empty lot below littered with abandoned
couches, refrigerators, rusting automobile carcasses.
And beyond the lot, the elementary school playground. Laughing
children on swings and slides. Jumping rope. Batting tether
balls. Playing hopscotch.
Moving slowly in on one of the hopscotch games. On a girl
tossing a bean bag into a square. Jumping over it and into the
next square. Turning and jumping back. Balancing on one foot.
Retrieving the bean bag and tossing it down again. Into the
next square of the tile pattern chalked on the asphalt.

</b>From above, patients in wheelchairs dot the black and white
checkerboard linoleum-tile floor like chess pieces. The
pattern is regular to a point but then breaks up -- is
interrupted by an area of solid white, where a wall once stood
-- before being restored. It forms a kind of narrow "sea," the
white area, on either side of which lies "land."

At floor level Sayer and Miss Costello, on their hands and
knees, are "blacking in" the missing tiles with shoe polish,
"bridging" the gap between the two checkerboards. The retarded
patients around them ignore them. The ward nurses pretend to. '
Completing the pattern Sayer glances across the room to
Leonard. He seems to be "watching." His mother, nearby, idly
thumbing through a magazine as she brings Leonard up to date on
neighborhood news, isn't.
                                     �t,   .

Sayer crosses to Lucy. Lifts her gently out of her chair.
Points her in the direction of the drinking fountain.
She begins to move. To step slowly over each tile. She
reaches the "bridge" and hesitates. Then crosses it.

Sayer doesn't know whether to applaud or cry. He does neither,
burying his emotions behind a professional mask instead, and
watches as Lucy, "delivered" to the other side, free now, lets
the regularity of the pattern guide her toward the fountain.
She nears it. She is almost there. Then she is. there. But
doesn't drink. Doesn't stop. She continues past it . . .
To a window, the window bevond the drinking fountain which
Sayer hadn't noticed before, had no reason to notice, had no
need to notice, with a broken pane allowing a view to the
outside.
She stares out at the traffic below, in hopes no doubt of
figuring out where she is.
And Sayer's eyes, behind which exhilaration and horror rise up,
shift from her to Miss Costello, and then to Leonard, in whose
mask of a face Sayer thinks he sees a faint glimmer.
These people are alive inside.

moments later next to the TV. She switches it off and turns to

<b>68.   INT. LEONARD'S WARD - LATER - NIGHT                               68.
</b>In a far corner of the darkened ward, in a pool of lamp light,
two silhouetted figures. Sayer and Leonard. Sleeping patients
all around them.
Sayer carefully, awkwardly, places   his hand on Leonard's.
After a moment, the contact brings   the useless appendage "to
life." As it slowly turns over and   grasps the doctor's hand, a
glimmer of life seems to appear in   Leonard's eyes as well.
Sayer, unfamiliar, it seems, with the feeling the contact
produces in him, nonetheless places his other hand on Leonard's
other. Soon it too turns and holds onto Sayer's.
The doctor draws both of Leonard's hands toward him and sets
them down on the pointer of an Ouija Board.
<b>                     SAYER
</b>           I'll begin moving the pointer
           toward the "L." For "Leonard."
           Once I feel you beginning to move
           it, I'll stop and you'll take .
           over. Do you understand?
 Leonard, of course, cannot say whether he does or not. The
look on his face is "thoughtful." The look on Sayer's, hopeful
and foolish.
<b>                       SAYER
</b>           I'm beginning . . .
The pointer begins to slowly move past stars and moons.
Judging from Sayer's expression he begins to feel Leonard's
movement of it and, presumably, stops his own.
<b>                      SAYER
</b>          Yes, good . . .
The pointer moves across the letters, but passes the "L"
without stopping. It stops on the "R."
<b>                    SAYER
</b>          No. No, I didn't make myself
          clear. My fault. I . . .     .
The pointer begins moving again, "interrupting" Sayer.      It
passes the "L" again, reaches the "I" and stops.
<b>                                                                       ..

 But the pointer is moving again.      It stops on the "L."
<b>                      SAYER
</b>            Yes. Yes. That's what I meant. .
            "L." Good. Now the "E."
 It begins moving again. But not to the "E." To the nK," where
 it hesitates briefly before moving again.
<b>                        SAYER

              s
Keeping one hand on the moving pointer, Sayer fumbles a pen
from his shirt pocket and scribbles on his lab coat what
Leonard has and is continuing to "write":

lab coat is on it. And on it is scrawled:

</b>He has to study it only a moment before he sees the meaning of
it; he quickly scratches out the last four letters,and adds a
slash between the "S" and the "P," so that it reads:

projector splashes a diagram of molecular structure (and the
silhouette of a raised hand) onto a screen. The neurochemist
traces the shadow to its maker in the audience.

                It has to do with a chemical in
                the midbrain, or rather the lack
                of it, called dopamine. L-Dopa
                replenishes this dopamine, making
                it possible for these patients
                to move more naturally.

beneath Leonard's hands.

wonder on his face.

her face, she's put on a nice dress, yet she remains unprepared
for this reunion. She can do nothing but stare at her "infant

slowly but with decent motor control.

Sayer makes a note. They are alone in the examination room
which, like most of the hospital, has little in it to indicate
that it is not the 1930's.

Leonard walks slowly across the room past the perception tests
and notes and Polaroids cluttering the wall. Coming back, he
pauses. He's looking at a picture of himself taped there.
Sayer watches him slowly reach his hands to his face to feel
his features. He stares at the photograph of himself, trying
to comprehend that which cannot be comprehended.
He's not younjg anymore.

      Sayer's smile tries to assure them both that it will happen
      just that way. He excuses himself, leaving Leonard with his
      mother, joins Miss Costello by the door and glances back. Mrs.
      Lowe is stroking Leonard's head as she hums a lullaby.

      has been cheated out of the greater"- part of his life, Leonard
      seems to have recovered extraordinarily.

</b>Sayer and Leonard emerge from the hospital and move under trees
along a path toward the parking lot. At a point, the doctor
realizes his patient is no longer at his side; he's several
steps back, feeling the sunshine on his skin.

      Though it is only a Toyota, its dashboard, to Leonard,
      resembles something out of Jules Verne. He allows Sayer to
      buckle his seatbelt for him and watches with fascination as
      Sayer performs the "complex" preparatory sequence necessary,
      apparently, to make the car go.
      The car pulls away. Above, framed in a second story window of
      one of the buildings, stands a lone figure looking out --
      Leonard's mother.

      amazement, classical music fills the interior

      and CONTINUES OVER:

      Buses which have grown over the decades to a behemoth scale.
      "Ultra-modern" housing projects and gas stations.
      "Futuristic" cars.
      Leonard cannot imagine a more enthralling re-introduction to
      the world and stares at it all with wonder. Everywhere he
      looks there is something "extraordinary."
<b>                           LEONARD

                 has become.

      Leonard puts his face close to it to appreciate its fragrance.
      He touches its petals gently, explores them, and is quietly
      astonished by the tactile sensation.
      Sayer watches. He, too, can appreciate wonders of the real
      world, especially those of a botanical nature, but not with, the
      purity or intensity Leonard can.
      Pulling back reveals them in the middle of a vast garden of
      countless thousands of roses.

another playing a very different kind of music, and listens to
it bemused but intrigued. It's John Lennon singing "A DAY IN

</b>and it CONTINUES OVER:

A disk, a frisbee, falls at Leonard's feet. He retrieves it
but has no idea what it is or what to do with it. Sayer
demonstrates the wrist action with an invisible one. Leonard
doesn't get it. Sayer takes it from him and flings it
pathetically not halfway back to its owners.
The music CONTINUES OVER:

and Sayer are handed cones and Leonard's attention moves to a
girl wearing an unbelievably short skirt.
Her boyfriend stares at Leonard. Sayer tries to pull his
charge's attention elsewhere. Leonard, finally, glances away,
up, to a sound overhead.
The music CONTINUES OVER:

    Sayer, exhausted from the day, hunts in vain through packing
    boxes on the floor for crackers, cookies, something he can
    offer his guest.
    He keeps glancing in at Leonard, who's wandering around the
    dining room, navigating around packing boxes, to browse at the

    peeking back in to see what Leonard is looking at now: a small             i
    framed photograph of a boy with a toy sailboat and a forlorn

               For fine print. Those are my

    Leonard's examining the frames of this last pair closely.

    Leonard returns the indestructible ones to their proper place
    and considers them all together.

     him. She leaves the cafeteria without a word.

     it back to Bainbridge Hospital.
     Fernando walks by and    out, leaving his salary check on the
     table. Then Ray, the    pharmacist, leaving his. Then the nurse
     who reluctantly read    "Moby Dick" to the patients. Then a
     cafeteria worker. A     secretary. A clerk. A janitor.

better."

          encysted, cocooned, enveloped in

          physiological equivalent of sleep

a photograph of a man than a motion picture of one.

The "before picture" of Leonard on the screen is replaced with
the "after" -- his eyes alert, his hands exploring a desk
microphone. He glances up and off at something.

somehow come to terms with it, to somehow resolve it. He nods
as he finds within himself some source of strength and looks
directly at the camera.

patrons visibly moved, almost shaken, and silent.
Eventually one of the patrons, an old woman, reaches into her
purse for her checkbook and a pen. Another patron, an elderly
man, pulls a checkbook and pen from an inside jacket pocket.
Another already has hers out in front of her ...
Sayer and Miss Costello exchange a glance. The room is
absolutely silent, except for the muted scratch of pens on
paper.

They move along a silent corridor that seems to stretch out
forever -- the doctor, the two nurses -- carrying themselves
professionally, with sobriety and restraint. But as they near
the ward, as they're joined by others, other nurses, orderlies,
their steps and hearts quicken. They break into a trot.

nurse, the others, and peer into the darkened room:
In the quiet, in the shadows, in the moonlight filtering in
through the windows, the post-encephalitics are emerging from
their "cocoons," rising from the "dead" like Lazarus from the
earth, reborn.
Moving slowly past the beds: A figure rediscovering the
feeling of her skin; another, the sound of his breath; another,'
the beating of her heart.
A figure still asleep . . . wakes. And for the first time in
nearly half a century sees herself in the world.
Tight on Sayer, on the look of awe on his face as he stares at
the scene going on in the darkened ward. His glance finds
Leonard who is sitting up in his bed, smiling.

        having a great time.
        At the bar, Sayer tries to get the attention of a young

           floor. Never more mortified in his life (it seems as if
