<b>      EXT. MARIGOLD PATH - DUSK
</b>
      A path of marigold petals leads up to an altar lovingly
      arranged in a humble cemetery. An old woman lights a candle
      as the smoke of burning copal wood dances lyrically upward...

      The smoke lifts up toward lines of papel picado �- cut paper
      banners -- that sway gently in the breeze.

<b>                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
</b>                  Sometimes I think I'm cursed...
                  'cause of something that happened
                  before I was even born.

      A story begins to play out on the papel picado.

<b>                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
</b>                  See, a long time ago there was this
                  family.

      The images on the papel picado come to life to illustrate a
      father, a mother, and a little girl. The family is happy.

<b>                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
</b>                  The pap�, he was a musician.

      The pap� plays guitar while the mother dances with her
      daughter.

<b>                             MIGUEL (V.O.)
</b>                  He and his family would sing, and
                  dance, and count their blessings...
                      (beat)
                  But he also had a dream... to play
                  for the world.
                      (beat)
                  And one day he left with his
                  guitar... and never returned.

      The man walks down a road, guitar slung on his back. In
      another vignette his daughter stands in the doorway, watching
      her pap� leave. Two feet step up next to her. It is her
      mam�, hardened.

      She shuts the door.





<b>                                                                     2.
</b>

<b>                             MIGUEL (V.O.)
</b>                  And the mam�...? She didn't have
                  time to cry over that walkaway
                  musician!
                      (beat)
                  After banishing all music from her
                  life...

      The woman gets rid of all of her husband's instruments and
      records.

<b>                             MIGUEL (V.O.)
</b>                  She found a way to provide for her
                  daughter...
                      (beat)
                  She rolled up her sleeves and she
                  learned to make shoes.
                      (beat)
                  She could have made candy!

      Amongst the papel picado, a stick swings at a strung up
      pi�ata which bursts with candy...

<b>                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
</b>                  Or fireworks!

      Fireworks go off in the background...

<b>                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
</b>                  Or sparkly underwear for wrestlers!

      Sparkly underwear and a luchador mask hang on a line amongst
      other linens...

<b>                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
</b>                  But no... she chose shoes...

      On the papel picado, the little girl becomes a young woman.

<b>                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
</b>                  Then she taught her daughter to
                  make shoes. And later, she taught
                  her son-in-law.

      She introduces a suitor to the family business.

<b>                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
</b>                  Then her grandkids got roped in.
                  As her family grew, so did the
                  business.

      In the next vignette, a bunch of goofy grandchildren join in
      the shoemaking. The shoe shop is full of family!




<b>                                                                     3.

<b>                             MIGUEL (V.O.)
</b>                  Music had torn her family apart,
                  but shoes held them all together.
                      (beat)
                  You see, that woman was my great-
                  great grandmother, Mam� Imelda.

      TILT DOWN from the papel picado to the


<b>      OFRENDA ROOM - DAY
</b>
      where a photo sits at the top of a beautiful altar. The
      photo features MAM� IMELDA -- serious, formidable. She holds
      a baby on her lap. Her husband stands beside her, but his
      face has been torn away.

<b>                             MIGUEL (V.O.)
</b>                  She died WAY before I was born.
                  But my family still tells her story
                  every year on D�a de los Muertos --
                  the Day of the Dead...
                      (beat)
                  And her little girl?

      Fade from the face of the little girl to present day MAM�
      COCO (97), a living raisin, convalescing in a wicker
      wheelchair.

<b>                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
</b>                  She's my great grandmother, Mam�
                  Coco.

      A boy (12) walks into frame and kisses her on the cheek.
      This is our narrator, MIGUEL.

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  Hol�, Mam� Coco.

<b>                            MAM� COCO
</b>                  How are you, Julio?

<b>                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
</b>                  Actually, my name is Miguel. Mam�
                  Coco has trouble remembering
                  things... But it's good to talk to
                  her anyway. So I tell her pretty
                  much everything.

      QUICK CUTS of Miguel with Mam� Coco:

      Miguel pumps his arms with his hands in fists.           Then he
      switches to flat palms.

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  But now I run like this which is
                  way faster!

      Miguel, in a luchador mask, climbs onto the bed, arms raised.

</b>                  And the winner is... Luchadora
                  Coco!

      Miguel leaps off the bed onto a pile of pillows that bursts,
      sending feathers onto Mam� Coco who wears a mask of her own.

</b>                  I have a dimple on this side, but

<b>                             ABUELITA
</b>                  Miguel!   Eat your food.

      Miguel's ABUELITA (70s) runs the table like a ship captain.
      She gives Mam� Coco a kiss on the head.

<b>                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
</b>                  My Abuelita? She's Mam� Coco's
                  daughter.

      Abuelita piles extra tamales on Miguel's plate.

      Miguel idly blows into a glass soda bottle.     Abuelita takes
      the bottle away.

      Miguel listens as a truck drives by the window, blaring radio
      tunes. Abuelita angrily slams the window shut.

      Terrified, the musicians stumble as they run away.

</b>                  I think we're the only family in
                  M�xico who hates music...


<b>      INT. RIVERA WORKSHOP - DAY
</b>
      We see the Rivera family tinkering in the shoe shop, no music
      to be heard. Miguel jogs past them.

<b>                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
</b>                  And my family's fine with that...

      He grabs his shine box, and heads out of the shoe shop.

<b>                              MIGUEL (V.O.)

      Once outside, Miguel makes his way through the small town of


<b>      SANTA CECILIA - MORNING

<b>                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
</b>                  I am NOT like the rest of my
                  family...

      He passes a woman sweeping a stoop.

<b>                            WOMAN
</b>                  Hola, Miguel!

<b>                              MIGUEL
</b>                  Hola!

      He passes a band of musicians playing a tune. Miguel joins
      with some air guitar and the further down the street he goes,
      the more instruments and sounds layer in. The bells of the
      church chime in harmony, a radio blares a cumbia rhythm.





<b>                                                                      7.

      Running past a food stand, Miguel grabs a roll of pan dulce
      and tosses the vendor a coin.

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  Muchas gracias!

<b>                            STREET VENDOR
</b>                  De nada, Miguel!

      As Miguel passes all these scenes, the music synthesizes and
      he can't help but tap out rhythms along a table of alebrijes.
      The fantastical wooden animal sculptures each play a
      different tone like a marimba. Miguel finishes with a SMACK
      on a trash can, out of which a pops up a scrappy hairless
      Xolo dog. The dog, DANTE, barks and jumps up to lick Miguel,
      who laughs.

<b>                              MIGUEL
</b>                  Hey, hey!    Dante!

      Miguel holds the pan dulce over Dante's head.

</b>                  Sit. Down. Roll over.        Shake.
                  Fist bump.

      Dante obeys to the best of his ability.

      back into the trash can.

      guitar.

      Miguel comes out of his reverie and looks up at the PLAZA
      MARIACHI whose shoes he is shining.

</b>                  Oh, yeah, sorry.

      He goes back to scrubbing the man's shoe.    As Miguel shines,
      the mariachi plucks his guitar idly.

                  onto that plaza and he played out

      The mariachi gets an idea. He points to the gazebo where
      organizers are setting up for a show. They unfurl a canvas
      poster which reads "TALENT SHOW."

      Miguel considers this.

      The mariachi appraises Miguel, then offers his guitar.

</b>                  Show me what you got, muchacho.
                  I'll be your first audience.

      Miguel's brows rise, surprised. He reaches to take the
      instrument, regarding it as if holding a holy relic.

      Miguel spreads his fingers across the strings anticipating
      his chord and...

</b><b>                  MIGUEL!

      Startled, Miguel impulsively throws the guitar back onto the
      mariachi's lap. He turns to see Abuelita marching toward
      him. Miguel's T�O BERTO (40s) and PRIMA ROSA (16), follow
      with supplies from the market.

<b>                              MIGUEL

      Miguel quickly packs away his shine rag and polishes.
      Abuelita barrels up to the mariachi.

      She hits his hat with her shoe and waves him away.

<b>                            ABUELITA

      Abuelita lords over the mariachi, shoe aimed directly between
      his eyes.

                  wants no part of your music,
                  mariachi! You keep away from him!

      The mariachi scrambles away, snatching his hat off the
      ground before he goes. Abuelita hugs Miguel protectively to
      her bosom.

<b>                            ABUELITA
</b>                  Ay, pobrecito! Est�s bien, mijo?

      She peppers him with kisses then releases him from the
      embrace. He gasps for air.

      Abuelita turns toward home. Miguel sighs and gathers his
      shine box. Then, seeing a flyer for the plaza "TALENT SHOW",
      he can't help but pocket it. He follows Abuelita.

      Abuelita shoos him away.

      Gasps from the family. PRIMO ABEL (19) is so shocked he
      loses his grip on the shoe he is polishing, which zips away
      from the polisher and lodges itself in the roof.

      Mam� Coco looks up at Abuelita.

<b>                            MAM� COCO
</b>                  Who are you?

      Sadness rises in Abuelita; she swallows it down.

<b>                            ABUELITA
</b>                  Rest, Mam�.

      Abuelita returns to the ofrenda.

                  Miguel... Miguel?

      She looks around the room. Miguel is nowhere to be found.
      Abuelita steps up to the ofrenda.

      She looks to the photo of Mam� Imelda.       Abuelita's eyes
      brighten with an idea.

<b>      EXT. SIDE STREET
</b>
      T�o Berto unloads rolls of leather from a truckbed. Nearby,
      Dante sleeps under the shade of a tree. He startles awake by
      a faint TWANGING. The dog scrambles up to the roof.

      He reaches a shoe sign advertising the Rivera Family business
      and lifts it up.


<b>      INT. ROOFTOP HIDEOUT
</b>
      Dante pokes his head in.      Miguel turns and gasps.





<b>                                                                    18.

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  Oh, it's you. Get in here, c'mon,
                  Dante. Hurry up.

      Dante wriggles into the hideout. Miguel is huddled over
      something. The dog peeks around his shoulder.

<b>                            MIGUEL (CONT'D)
</b>                  You're gonna get me in trouble,
                  boy. Someone could hear me!

      Miguel reveals a makeshift guitar, cobbled together from a
      beat up old soundboard and random other items.

      He takes a china marker and sketches a nose on what appears
      to be his own version of a skull guitar head.

<b>                            MIGUEL (CONT'D)
</b>                  I wish someone wanted to hear me...

      Miguel tunes the guitar.

<b>                            MIGUEL (CONT'D)
</b>                  Other than you...

      Dante gives Miguel a big sloppy lick. Miguel gives a grossed-
      out chuckle. He lifts his guitar and strums.

<b>                              MIGUEL (CONT'D)
</b>                  Perfecto!

      He crawls to the far side of the attic where he's built his
      own ofrenda to Ernesto de la Cruz. Posters, candles, and
      songbooks are arranged with care. Miguel lights the candles
      with reverence, illuminating an album cover of de la Cruz
      holding his skull guitar.

      Miguel compares the head of his guitar to the album cover.
      Then he imitates de la Cruz's pose and smile.

      He switches on a beat up old TV and pushes a tape into the
      VCR, "Best of de la Cruz" scrawled on the spine.

      A montage of the greatest moments from de la Cruz's films
      plays out.

      A clip from "A QUIEN YO AMO:"

<b>                            DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP)
</b>                  I have to sing. I have to play.
                  The music, it's -- it's not just in
                  me. It is me.





<b>                                                                     19.
</b>

      Miguel strums his guitar as de la Cruz imparts his wisdom.
      More clips run in the background as Miguel plays:

<b>                            DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP)
</b>                  When life gets me down, I play my
                  guitar.

      In a clip from "A QUIEN YO AMO:"

<b>                            DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP)
</b>                  The rest of the world may follow
                  the rules, but I must follow my
                  heart!

      De la Cruz kisses a woman passionately.      Miguel cringes.

      Another clip from "A QUIEN YO AMO:"

<b>                            DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP)
</b>                  You know that feeling? Like
                  there's a song in the air and it's
                  playing just for you...

      As Miguel watches de la Cruz play guitar in the video, he
      repeats the melody on his own guitar.

<b>                            DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP)

      As a good-natured priest in "NUESTRA IGLESIA:"

<b>                            DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP)
</b>                  You must have faith, sister.

</b><b>                  ONLY A SONG

      Miguel loses himself in the music.





<b>                                                                         20.

</b>                  Never underestimate the power of
                  music...

      Miguel's tune intertwines with the melodies on the TV set.
      The clip jumps forward:

<b>                            LOLA (FILM CLIP)
</b>                  But my father, he will never give

<b>                            DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP)
</b>                  I am done asking permission. When
                  you see your moment you mustn't let
                  it pass you by, you must seize it!

      The tape ends with an interview clip.

<b>                            INTERVIEWER (FILM CLIP)

</b>                  I had to have faith in my dream.
                  No one was going to hand it to me.
                  It was up to me to reach for that
                  dream, grab it tight, and make it
                  come true.

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  ...and make it come true.

      The tape ends. The words sink into Miguel.        He reaches for
      the flyer for the plaza "TALENT SHOW."

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  No more hiding, Dante.      I gotta

      Dante wags his tail, panting happily.

      Children run by with sparklers as Abuelita opens the doors to
      the family compound.

<b>                            ABUELITA
</b>                  D�a de los Muertos has begun!

      In the courtyard, two TODDLER COUSINS haphazardly scatter
      marigold petals from their baskets.

<b>                            MAM�
</b>                  No, no, no, no, no.

      Mam� corrects them, creating a path from the ofrenda room to
      the front gate.

<b>                            MAM� (CONT'D)
</b>                  We have to make a clear path. The
                  petals guide our ancestors home. We
                  don't want their spirits to get
                  lost. We want them to come, and
                  enjoy all the food and drinks on
                  the ofrenda, s�?

      As Mam� teaches, Miguel and Dante sneak across the roof and
      drop to the sidewalk outside the compound, Miguel clutching
      his guitar.

      Suddenly T�o Berto and Pap� round the corner carrying a small
      table from storage.

<b>                            PAP�
</b>                  Mam�, where should we put this
                  table?

      Miguel and Dante back up to avoid the adults, only to find
      Abuelita sweeping the sidewalk behind them! Miguel and Dante
      jump into the back into the Rivera courtyard before she sees
      them.

<b>                            ABUELITA

<b>                             ABUELITA

<b>      INT. OFRENDA ROOM
</b>
      Miguel backs out of the courtyard and into the family ofrenda
      room. Nearly cornered, he ushers Dante past a sleeping Mam�
      Coco. He stashes the dog and the guitar under the ofrenda
      table.





<b>                                                                         22.

      room darkened by three figures.

<b>                              MIGUEL
</b>                  Nothing!

      His Abuelita and parents stare straight at him.     A pit grows
      in his stomach; he's been caught.

<b>                            MIGUEL (CONT'D)
</b>                  Mam� -- Pap�, I--

                  We've all decided -- it's time you
                  joined us in the workshop!

      Abuelita hands Pap� a leather apron, which he hangs over
      Miguel's shoulders.

<b>                              MIGUEL

                  school!

      Abuelita shuffles toward Miguel squealing.      She squeezes his
      cheeks, full of pride.

<b>                            ABUELITA

      Pap� heads out of the room, Mam� follows. Last is Abuelita,
      who smothers Miguel with tons of kisses as she leaves.

      With the family gone, Miguel deflates.

      Suddenly, a noise comes from the ofrenda. Miguel turns to
      find Dante on the bottom tier, licking a plate of mole to his
      heart's content. Miguel is horrified!

<b>                             MIGUEL
</b>                  Dante!   No, Dante, stop!

      Miguel pulls the dog away from the ofrenda, but the table
      shakes. The frame with Mam� Imelda's photo sways back and
      forth, then topples to the ground with a sickening crack.

<b>                            MIGUEL (CONT'D)

      Miguel picks up the old photo of Mam� Imelda, which unfolds
      to reveal another portion, hidden all these years;

      the man with no face is revealed to be holding a familiar
      skull-headed guitar.

<b>                            MIGUEL

      Miguel turns, startled. Mam� Coco points a crooked finger at
      the picture in his hand.

<b>                              MAM� COCO (CONT'D)

      Miguel's eyes go wide as the connection dawns on him.   Could

      Miguel goes to his secret ofrenda, to the record album of
      Ernesto de la Cruz. He compares the guitar in the family
      photo with the guitar on the sleeve. An exact match!

      Miguel runs to the edge of the roof, overlooking the

      Miguel lifts his guitar to play when Abuelita snatches the
      instrument away. She points to the man in the photo.

      Gasps from the family.      Abuelita's brow hardens.   She lifts
      the guitar in the air.

      repair.

<b>      EXT. SIDE STREET

      Miguel bursts out of the compound, desperate to get away.
      Dante, nose buried in a trash bag, hears Miguel and chases
      after him. Miguel runs past a poster for the plaza "TALENT

<b>      EXT. MARIACHI PLAZA - EVENING

      Miguel approaches a STAGE MANAGER in the gazebo.

      Disheartened, Miguel walks away.       He finds himself facing the
      statue of de la Cruz.

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  Great-great grandfather... What am
                  I supposed to do?

      No answer. Miguel's gaze falls on a plaque at the base of
      the statue that reads "Seize Your Moment!" Miguel looks at
      the photo in his hand. He moves his thumb to reveal the
      skull head guitar. Then, a firework illuminates the skull
      head guitar that the statue holds. Miguel gets an idea.


<b>      EXT. CEMETERY - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
      A sea of candles and flowers, families gathered at graves.

      Miguel sneaks through the cemetery unnoticed, slipping from
      one shadow to the next.

      Dante suddenly catches up to Miguel.         He barks excitedly.

<b>                            MIGUEL

      Miguel swipes a chicken leg off a neighboring grave, and
      chucks it. Dante bounds after the food.

<b>      EXT. DE LA CRUZ'S MAUSOLEUM
</b>
      Miguel slinks around the side of the tomb.   He looks in one
      of the windows.

      Inside, the famous guitar hangs above the crypt. Fireworks
      pop; bursts of light glint off the instrument. It seems to
      beckon him. He tries the window but it's locked.

      More fireworks shoot into the sky.

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  I'm sorry...

      Timing to the explosions, Miguel throws his shoulder into the
      rusted-shut window pane and forces it open with a scraping
      KRRRR-LANK! He slinks inside the tomb.


<b>      INT. DE LA CRUZ'S MAUSOLEUM
</b>
      Miguel drops down to the mausoleum floor. The noise from
      outside is muffled. He climbs onto the crypt, slightly
      moving the lid. He stifles a gasp.

      He crawls over the marble sarcophagus and comes face-to-face
      with the famed guitar. Miguel wipes away a layer of dust,
      revealing the rich painted wood beneath. He looks up to the
      portrait of de la Cruz.

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  Se�or de la Cruz? Please don't be

                  grandson... I need to borrow this.

      Heart in his throat, Miguel lifts the guitar off its mount.
      Unbeknownst to him, some marigold petals in the mausoleum
      begin to sparkle.

<b>                            MIGUEL (CONT'D)

                  me to follow my heart. To seize my
                  moment!

      He backs up, in full view of the painting.

      Confidence building, he strums it once.

      The air around him vibrates -- radiating like a shock wave.
      The petals on the ground whirl and surge with light for just
      a moment. Miguel is visibly taken aback. What just
      happened?

      Suddenly, a flashlight shines in the window of the mausoleum.

<b>                            VOICES (O.S.)

      Miguel hears keys jangling and the door unlocking.   A
      GROUNDSKEEPER enters with a flashlight.

<b>                            GROUNDSKEEPER
</b>                  Alright, who's in there?

      Startled, Miguel puts down the guitar.

      The groundskeeper walks straight through Miguel!   He doesn't
      even see him!

<b>                            GROUNDSKEEPER

      A panicked Miguel runs out, trying to figure out what's going
      on! But the people in the cemetery walk through him too.

      Suddenly he hears a familiar voice.

<b>                              MAM�

      Miguel turns to see Pap� and Mam� still searching for him.

      Frantic, Miguel trips and falls into an open grave.      A nearby
      woman gasps and peeks over the ledge of the grave.

<b>                              WOMAN

      They see each other face to face.       The woman is a skeleton!
      Miguel screams! She does too!

      Miguel backs away. He turns to see another skeleton. He
      falls backwards and scoots away frantically. He bumps into
      another skeleton whose head falls off and lands in Miguel's
      hands.

      Miguel tosses the head away from him and turns to see the
      whole cemetery is teeming with skeletons! And they can all
      see him!

      He races off and hides behind a grave. After a moment, he
      peeks over the headstone to watch the skeletons engaging with
      their living families.

      One couple dances.

      Another man reaches for offerings on his grave, which
      solidify in his hands when he takes them.

      A couple of skeletons coo over a toddler.

      Miguel gives chase until -� BAM! He runs smack into a
      mustached skeleton and falls to the ground. The skeleton's
      bones break apart and scatter. The head pops up.

      The bones magically pull away from Miguel.

<b>                            PAP� JULIO
</b>                  You're here! HERE here!

      PAP� JULIO reconstitutes himself.

<b>                            PAP� JULIO (CONT'D)
</b>                  And you can see us?!

      T�A ROSITA charges through Pap� Julio, sending his bones
      scattering again. She grabs Miguel, hugging him tight.

      Miguel, smothered by Rosita's ample ribcage, struggles for
      air.

      way. T�A VICTORIA straightens it.

      T�a Victoria pokes Miguel's cheek, skeptical.

<b>                            T�A VICTORIA

      A living person ambles through Miguel's non-corporeal form.

      Pap� Julio grabs Miguel by the arm and the family rushes
      through the cemetery, trailed by Dante.


<b>      EXT. CEMETERY - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
      Miguel and his family weave through the graves, rounding a
      corner.

      His gaze falls upon a glowing MARIGOLD BRIDGE arching before
      them.

<b>                               MIGUEL
</b>                  Whoa...

      The bridge extends into the mist.        A stream of skeletons
      amble across for the holiday.





<b>                                                                      35.
</b>

      The family passes through an invisible barrier onto the
      bridge. Their bodies change from ghostly to solid. Miguel
      hesitates at the threshold.

<b>                            PAP� JULIO
</b>                  Come on, Miguel. It's ok.

      Miguel follows after the family, the petals glowing under his
      feet. Dante takes off.

<b>                             MIGUEL
</b>                  Dante!   Dante! Dante, wait up!

      Miguel runs after Dante, finally catching up to the dog as he
      rolls in the petals at the crest of the bridge. He sneezes
      some petals into Miguel's face.

<b>                            MIGUEL (CONT'D)
</b>                  You gotta stay with me, boy.       We
                  don't know... where...

      Out of the mist, the sparkling cityscape of the Land of the
      Dead emerges. It's breathtaking. His family sidles up.

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  This isn't a dream, then.        You're
                  all really out there...

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  Well I don't know, I thought it
                  might've been one of those made up
                  things that adults tell kids...
                  like... vitamins.

<b>                            T�A VICTORIA
</b>                  Miguel, vitamins are a real thing.

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  Well, now I'm thinking maybe they
                  could be...

      As skeletons pass in the other direction, Miguel receives
      some strange looks. A little skeleton girl gasps, pointing
      at him.

<b>                            SKELETON MOTHER

</b>

      The woman goes wide-eyed, her head turning backwards to gawk
      at Miguel as she walks in the opposite direction. Miguel
      puts up his hood.

      The Riveras continue on toward an arrivals area on the far
      side of the bridge. Miguel sees fantastical creatures
      crawling, flying, making nests in the nearby architecture.

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  Are those...? Alebrijes!         But

      They get to the far edge of the Marigold Bridge.

      An ELDERLY COUPLE steps in front of a camera-mounted monitor.
      The monitor scans their faces and returns an image of their
      photos on an altar in the Land of the Living.

      step onto the bridge, which begins to glow as they gain
      footing.

      H�CTOR (early 20s), a ragged fellow, steps up to the monitor,
      disguised as Frida Kahlo.

      negative buzzing sound.

      H�ctor bolts for the bridge. A security guards blocks the
      gate. H�ctor splits in two and slides past the guard, half
      going over, half under.

<b>                              H�CTOR

      H�ctor reaches the bridge at a sprint, but the magic doesn't
      engage; he sinks right into the petals.

</b>                  Almost there, just a little
                  further...!

      The guards saunter to the bridge and casually pull H�ctor
      back toward the Land of the Dead.

      Mam� Imelda coldly eyes the Macintosh 128k on the woman's
      desk.

<b>                            MAM� IMELDA

      In a swift movement, Mam� Imelda removes her shoe and smacks
      the computer.

<b>                            PAP� JULIO
</b>                  Mam� Imelda?

      She turns her shoe on Pap� Julio, who leans back and yelps.
      Mam� Imelda softens.

<b>                            MAM� IMELDA

</b>                  We ran into... um...

      Mam� Imelda's eyes fall on Miguel.

      Miguel looks at Mam� Imelda.       Her photo flashes before him.

      Miguel realizes something.        He sheepishly pulls out the

                  The way to undo a family curse is
                  to get your family's blessing.

<b>                               MIGUEL

      Miguel looks at his hand. The tip of one of his fingers has
      started to turn skeletal. He turns pale. He starts to faint
      when Pap� Julio picks him up and gently slaps him awake.

<b>                            PAP� JULIO

                  right now.

      The clerk searches the ground near T�a Rosita.

<b>                            CLERK

                  Perd�n, se�ora.

      T�a Rosita titters. The clerk plucks a marigold petal from
      the hem of her dress. He hands the petal to Mam� Imelda.

<b>                            CLERK

                  his name.

      Imelda turns to Miguel.

<b>                               MAM� IMELDA
</b>                  Miguel.

<b>                               CLERK

<b>                            MAM� IMELDA
</b>                  I give you my blessing.

      The marigold petal glows in her fingers.            Miguel brightens.
      But Mam� Imelda is not finished.

<b>                            MAM� IMELDA (CONT'D)
</b>                  I give you my blessing to go
                  home...

      The glow of the marigold petal surges.

<b>                             MAM� IMELDA (CONT'D)
</b>                  To put my photo back on the
                  ofrenda...

      Each added condition makes the petal glow brighter.           Imelda
      delivers it like a scolding, but Miguel nods.

<b>                            MAM� IMELDA (CONT'D)
</b>                  And to never play music again!

      The petal surges one last time.





<b>                                                                          45.

<b>                             MIGUEL

</b>                  Well technically she can add any
                  conditions she wants.

      Miguel stares her down.      Imelda is firm in her resolve.

<b>                              MIGUEL
</b>                  Fine.

</b>                      (to Imelda)
                  Then you hand the petal to Miguel.

      Imelda extends the petal to Miguel, who reaches for it.

      He grabs the petal. WHOOOOSH!        He's consumed by a whirlwind
      of petals and disappears.

<b>      DE LA CRUZ'S MAUSOLEUM - NIGHT
</b>
      He reappears in a whirlwind of petals. It seems like he's
      solid. He runs to the window and looks out.

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  No skeletons!

      Miguel laughs, relieved. Then, a mischievous smile on his
      face, he turns and eyes de la Cruz's guitar.

      Miguel quickly grabs the guitar.

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  Mariachi Plaza, here I come--

      He takes two steps toward the door, then WHOOOOSH!

<b>      CLERK'S OFFICE - SAME TIME
</b>
      Miguel appears back in the clerk's office in another flash of
      the marigold whirlwind, without the guitar. The family
      turns, shocked to see him back so soon.

      Miguel realizes his hands are still in guitar-holding
      position.

<b>                            MAM� IMELDA

                  already had yours!

      Miguel grabs another petal, he marches over to Pap� Julio.

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  Pap� Julio, I ask for your

      Pap� Julio shakes his head and pulls his hat down.

</b>                  Don't make this hard, mijo.      You go

<b>                            MIGUEL

</b>                  I will not let you go down the same

      Miguel gets an idea.     He pulls the photo out and turns from
      the group.

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  The same path he did.

      He gazes at the man with no face.

      Miguel sees himself out.      The family waits for a beat.

<b>                            CLERK
</b>                  Uh, should we tell him there are no

<b>      INT. STAIRCASE - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
      Miguel hustles down a staircase with Dante. Once on the
      ground floor, they huddle beneath the staircase. He looks to
      the upper floor. The Dead Riveras are there. T�o Oscar asks
      a PATROLWOMAN about a boy of Miguel's height. The
      patrolwoman picks up her walkie-talkie.

      Miguel scopes the ground floor and spies a revolving door
      exit.

<b>                              MIGUEL
</b>                  V�monos.

      Miguel puts up his hood, tightening it to a tiny eye hole,
      and heads out. Dante pads after him.

<b>                            PATROLWOMAN

                  my great-great grandpa.

      The exit gets closer when Miguel is stopped by a PATROLMAN.

<b>                            PATROLMAN
</b>                  Hold it, muchacho.

      Miguel's hoodie loosens to reveal his living face.

<b>                              PATROLMAN
</b>                  Ahh!

      The patrolman frantically grabs for his walkie-talkie.

<b>                            PATROLMAN
</b>                  I've found that living boy!

      A large family passes between Miguel and the officer, chatty,
      arms full of offerings.

      H�ctor leans gratefully toward the officer, overwhelmed with
      mock emotion.

      Miguel suddenly spies his family hurrying down a staircase.
      Mam� Imelda spots Miguel.

      Miguel grabs H�ctor by the wrist and drags him to the exit,
      away from his family.


<b>      EXT. MARIGOLD GRAND CENTRAL STATION

      Miguel and Dante burst out the door and rush down the stairs.
      H�ctor's arm snaps to get Miguel's attention. Miguel
      realizes it's no longer attached to H�ctor's body. The arm
      signals backwards to H�ctor who is ten paces behind.

<b>                            H�CTOR
</b>                  Esp�rame chamaco!

      Miguel throws the arm back to H�ctor an they disappear into a
      dense crowd.

      Moments later, the Dead Riveras burst from the revolving
      doors. Mam� Imelda scours the crowd for Miguel. He's
      nowhere to be found.

                  Pepita.

      Mam� Imelda looks to the night sky, puts two fingers to her
      mouth, and lets out a piercing whistle.

      FWOOOMP! A giant winged jaguar lands in front of Mam�
      Imelda. She turns to the family.

      Pap� Julio steps forward with a marigold petal.      He creeps
      forward, jittery, holding it out for Pepita.

<b>                            PAP� JULIO

      Pepita sniffs the petal's scent.

      Suddenly Pepita's head darts, narrowing in on the scent.         She
      takes to the air.

<b>                            H�CTOR

                  Ceci...

      As H�ctor tries to talk her down, Dante wanders away from
      the costume area.

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  Dante... Dante!

      Miguel chases after him.


<b>      INT. REHEARSAL AREA
</b>
<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  We shouldn't be in here...

      Miguel follows Dante through a giant warehouse, divided into
      different artists workspaces. He passes papier-m�ch�
      sculptures, giant paper cut out banners, a skeleton posing
      nude for a painter...

      Dante sniffs around. Suddenly an ALEBRIJE MONKEY jumps out
      at Dante. The monkey starts riding Dante, tormenting him.
      Miguel hustles after him.

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  No, no, Dante! Ven ac�!

      The monkey jumps up onto the shoulder of FRIDA KAHLO, the
      REAL Frida Kahlo, who stands in front of a rehearsal stage.
      Miguel reins Dante in just as Frida turns to find them.

<b>                              FRIDA
</b>                  You!    How did you get in here?

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  I just followed my--





<b>                                                                            57.
</b>

      Frida's eyes go wide when she sees Dante.            She kneels and
      takes his head in her hands.

<b>                             FRIDA
</b>                  Oh, the mighty Xolo dog...! Guider
                  of wandering spirits...!
                      (beat)
                  And whose spirit have you guided to
                  me?

      Frida takes a closer look at Miguel.

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  I don't think he's a spirit guide.

<b>                            FRIDA
</b>                  Ah-ah-ah. The alebrijes of this
                  world can take many forms... They
                  are as mysterious as they are
                  powerful...

      The patterns on Frida's monkey swirl and he opens his mouth
      to breath a blue fire. He fumbles at the end with a chesty
      cough.

      Then they look to Dante, who is chewing his own leg.
      Suddenly, Frida turns back to Miguel.

<b>                            FRIDA (CONT'D)
</b>                  Or maybe he's just a dog.        Come!    I
                  need your eyes!

      Frida guides him to view the rehearsal space.

<b>                             FRIDA
</b>                  You are the audience.
                      (beat)
                  Darkness. And from the darkness...
                  A giant PAPAYA!

      Lights come up on a giant papaya prop.

<b>                            FRIDA
</b>                  Dancers emerge from the papaya and
                  the dancers are all me!

      Leotarded, unibrowed dancers crawl around the sides of the
      mesh papaya. Behind the papaya is an even larger half-
      finished mesh structure.





<b>                                                                           58.

<b>                            FRIDA (CONT'D)
</b>                  And they go to drink from the milk
                  of their mother who is a cactus,
                  but who is also me. And her milk
                  is not milk but tears.
                      (to Miguel)
                  Is it too obvious?

<b>                             MIGUEL
</b>                  I think it's just the right amount
                  of obvious?
                      (beat)
                  It could use some music... Oh!
                  What if you did, like, doonk-doonk-
                  doonk-doonk...

      Frida, inspired, cues some musicians who start playing the
      tune.

<b>                            MIGUEL (CONT'D)
</b>                  Oh! And then it could go dittle-
                  ittle-dittle-ittle-dittle-ittle-
                  dittle-ittle -- WHAAA!

      The violins follow; a trombone punctuates.

<b>                            FRIDA
</b>                  And... what if everything was on
                  fire? Yes! Fire everywhere!

      The dancers gasp and look at each other, now concerned.

<b>                            FRIDA
</b>                  Inspired!
                      (leaning in)
                  You... you have the spirit of an
                  artist!

      Miguel brightens.     Frida turns back to the rehearsal.

<b>                            FRIDA
</b>                  The dancers exit, the music fades,
                  the lights go out! And Ernesto de
                  la Cruz rises to the stage!

      A silhouette rises from a trap door.         Miguel leans forward.

      A spotlight shines on the silhouette revealing it to be a
      mannequin.

<b>                              MIGUEL
</b>                  Huh?





<b>                                                                    59.
</b>

<b>                            FRIDA
</b>                  He does a couple of songs, the sun
                  rises, everyone cheers--

      Miguel hustles up to Frida.

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  Excuse me, where's the real de la

<b>                            FRIDA
</b>                  Ernesto doesn't do rehearsals.
                  He's too busy hosting that fancy
                  party at the top of his tower.

      She gestures out a large window to a GRAND ESTATE lit up in
      the distance, atop a steep hill.

      Suddenly H�ctor rounds the corner, out of breath.

<b>                            H�CTOR
</b>                  Chamaco! You can't run off on me

                  the celebrities...

      H�ctor pulls Miguel away, but Miguel won't be wrangled.

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  You said my great-great grandpa

      H�ctor walks away from Miguel toward the musicians.

                  on, ask him how he died!

      Miguel looks to H�ctor, eyebrow cocked.

<b>                            H�CTOR
</b>                  I don't want to talk about it.

      The musicians laugh.     Miguel tries to stifle a giggle.

<b>                            H�CTOR
</b>                  I didn't choke, okay -- I got food
                  poisoning, which is a big

      More laughter.

      Miguel's wheels start turning.

      Miguel looks to his hands, progressed in their skeletal
      transformation.

      Pepita sweeps across the sky, landing in a darkened corner.
      She casts a shadow on the wall, then lurches into the light.
      She sniffs out the spot where H�ctor painted Miguel's face,
      finding a canister of shoe polish. She lets out a low growl.

      The Dead Riveras follow after her.

<b>                            MAM� IMELDA

      Pepita breathes on the ground, revealing a footprint.   It
      glows for a moment. The family leans in to inspect.

      reveal a trail of footprints.

      Miguel follows H�ctor down a steep stairway.     Miguel looks to
      his bony knuckles, concern on his face.

<b>                            H�CTOR

      As Miguel descends the staircase, de la Cruz's distant
      glowing tower is obscured by old forgotten buildings.

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  So, how far is this guitar anyway?

      H�ctor jumps from the stairway and crashes on the ground
      below. But his bones reassemble immediately.

      H�ctor leads Miguel through a stone archway.


<b>      EXT. SHANTY TOWN
</b>
      Graffiti on the archway depicts skeletal angels with wings
      the color of marigolds.

      Inside the archway, a group of ratty skeletons huddle around
      a burning trashcan and laugh raucously. They are gray and
      dusty, not unlike H�ctor, but there's a camaraderie about
      them.

      They approach three old ladies playing cards around a wooden
      crate. One, T�A CHELO looks up.

                  Chicharr�n around?

<b>                            T�A CHELO
</b>                  In the bungalow. I don't know if
                  he's in the mood for visitors...

<b>                            H�CTOR
</b>                  Who doesn't like a visit from
                  Cousin H�ctor?


<b>      INT. SHANTY BUNGALOW TENT
</b>
      H�ctor holds the curtain open.       Miguel and Dante walk in.

      The tent is cramped, dark, and quiet. Piles are organized
      everywhere: stacks of old dishes, a drawer full of pocket
      watches, magazines, records. This place belongs to a
      collector of things. Miguel almost knocks one stack over.

      H�ctor spies a hammock piled with old junk, a dusty hat on
      top. He lifts the hat and finds the grumpy face of
<b>      CHICHARR�N.
</b>
<b>                            H�CTOR
</b>                  Buenas noches, Chicharr�n!

<b>                            CHICHARR�N
</b>                  I don't want to see your stupid
                  face, H�ctor.

<b>                            H�CTOR
</b>                  C'mon, it's D�a de Muertos! I
                  brought you a little offering!

<b>                            CHICHARR�N
</b>                  Get out of here...

<b>                            H�CTOR
</b>                  I would, Cheech, but the thing
                  is... me and my friend, Miguel, we
                  really need to borrow your guitar.

<b>                            CHICHARR�N
</b>                  My guitar?!

<b>                              H�CTOR
</b>                  Yes?




<b>                                                                   65.
</b>

<b>                            CHICHARR�N
</b>                  My prized, beloved guitar...?

<b>                            H�CTOR
</b>                  I promise we'll bring it right
                  back.

      Chicharr�n sits up, incensed.

<b>                            CHICHARR�N
</b>                  Like the time you promised to bring
                  back my van?

<b>                              H�CTOR
</b>                  Uh...

<b>                            CHICHARR�N
</b>                  Or my mini-fridge?

<b>                            H�CTOR
</b>                  Ah, you see�-

<b>                            CHICHARR�N
</b>                  Or my good napkins? My lasso?    My
                  femur?!

<b>                            H�CTOR
</b>                  No, no, not like those times.

<b>                            CHICHARR�N
</b>                  Where's my femur?! You--

      Chicharr�n raises his finger to give a tongue lashing. But
      then he weakens and collapses in his hammock, a golden
      flicker flashing through his bones. H�ctor rushes forward.

<b>                            H�CTOR
</b>                  Whoa, whoa -- you okay, amigo?

<b>                             CHICHARR�N
</b>                  I'm fading, H�ctor. I can feel it.
                      (looking to guitar)
                  I couldn't even play that thing if
                  I wanted to.
                      (beat)
                  You play me something.

      H�ctor looks surprised.

<b>                            H�CTOR
</b>                  You know I don't play anymore,
                  Cheech. The guitar's for the kid--





<b>                                                                           66.
</b>

<b>                            CHICHARR�N
</b>                  You want it, you got to earn it...

      H�ctor sighs, then reaches over Chicharr�n and takes the
      instrument.

<b>                            H�CTOR
</b>                  Only for you, amigo.     Any requests?

      H�ctor begins tuning the guitar.

<b>                            CHICHARR�N
</b>                  You know my favorite, H�ctor.

      H�ctor begins a lovely, lilting tune. Chicharr�n smiles.
      Miguel's eyes go wide at H�ctor's skill.

<b>                             H�CTOR
</b>                      (singing)
<b>                  WELL EVERYONE KNOWS JUANITA,

</b><b>                  AND HER...
</b>
      H�ctor eyes Miguel.

<b>                            H�CTOR (CONT'D)
</b><b>                  ...KNUCKLES THEY DRAG ON THE FLOOR.
</b>
<b>                            CHICHARR�N
</b>                  Those aren't the words!

<b>                            H�CTOR
</b>                  There are children present.
                      (continuing)
<b>                  HER HAIR IS LIKE A BRIAR,
</b><b>                  SHE STANDS IN A BOW-LEGGED STANCE.
</b><b>                  AND IF I WEREN'T SO UGLY,
</b><b>                  SHE'D POSSIBLY GIVE ME A CHANCE!
</b>
      H�ctor finishes with a soft flourish.

      Chicharr�n is tickled, joyful.       For a moment he's present and
      bright.

<b>                            CHICHARR�N
</b>                  Brings back memories.     Gracias...

      His eyes close.    He looks at peace.        H�ctor looks sad.

      Suddenly, the edges of Chicharr�n's bones begin to glow.         A
      soft, beautiful light. Then... he dissolves into dust.




<b>                                                                  67.
</b>

      Miguel is stunned, concerned.

      H�ctor picks up his shot glass, lifts it in honor, and
      drinks. He places it rim down next to Chicharr�n's glass,
      which is still full.

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  Wait... what happened?

<b>                             H�CTOR
</b>                  He's been forgotten.
                      (beat)
                  When there's no one left in the
                  living world who remembers you, you
                  disappear from this world. We call
                  it the "Final Death."

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  Where did he go?

<b>                            H�CTOR
</b>                  No one knows.

      Miguel has a thought.

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  But I've met him... I could
                  remember him, when I go back...

<b>                             H�CTOR
</b>                  No, it doesn't work like that,
                  chamaco. Our memories... they have
                  to be passed down by those who knew
                  us in life -- in the stories they
                  tell about us. But there's no one
                  left alive to pass down Cheech's
                  stories...

      Miguel is deep in thought.

      H�ctor puts his hand on Miguel's back, suddenly cheerful.

<b>                            H�CTOR (CONT'D)
</b>                  Hey, it happens to everyone

      He gives Miguel the guitar.

<b>                            H�CTOR (CONT'D)
</b>                  C'mon "de la Cruzcito." You've got
                  a contest to win.





<b>                                                                         68.
</b>

      H�ctor throws open the curtain and exits.      Miguel looks back
      at the glasses, then turns and follows.


<b>      EXT. LAND OF THE DEAD
</b>
      H�ctor and Miguel hang off the back of a moving trolley.
      Miguel holds H�ctor's photo in his hands, scanning it, while
      H�ctor fiddles on the guitar idly.

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  You told me you hated musicians,
                  you never said you were one.

<b>                            H�CTOR
</b>                  How do you think I knew your great-
                  great grandpa? We used to play
                  music together. Taught him
                  everything he knows.

      H�ctor plays a fancy riff, but botches the last note.

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  No manches! You played with
                  Ernesto de la Cruz, the greatest
                  musician of all time?

<b>                            H�CTOR
</b>                  Ha-ha, you're funny! Greatest

</b>                  You don't know what you're talking
                  about...

      The trolley arrives at the stop for the PLAZA DE LA CRUZ.
      There's a giant statue of Ernesto de la Cruz in the center.
      Miguel pockets H�ctor's photo.

<b>                             H�CTOR

      H�ctor hands the guitar to Miguel.

      QUICK CUTS: Energetic plaza shots. Lights and colors,
      beautiful dresses, violins, pyrotechnic bullfight, dancing.
      A t-shirt vendor is selling "de la Cruz" shirts.

      A stage is set up in the plaza.

      marimba on the back    of a giant iguana alebrije, a DJ with a
      laptop and keyboard    setup, a dog orchestra, nuns playing

      Miguel and H�ctor stand amongst other contestants.

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  Definitely "Remember Me."

      Miguel plucks out the beginnings of de la Cruz's most famous
      song. H�ctor clamps his hand over the fretboard.

<b>                            H�CTOR

<b>                            MIGUEL

</b>                  Ehck, it's too popular.

      Elsewhere backstage, they notice multiple other acts
      rehearsing their versions.

      One man plays water glasses to the famous tune.   H�ctor looks
      at Miguel as if to ask, "Need I say more?"

      wild. They're very good.

</b>
      Miguel peeks at the frenzied audience from backstage.   He
      looks sick and begins to pace, fidgety.

<b>                            H�CTOR

      H�ctor looks in Miguel's eyes.       The kid is sincere.   Despite
      himself, H�ctor softens.

      H�ctor's face contorts with a mix of encouragement and dread.


<b>      ON STAGE
</b>
      Miguel slowly takes the stage, guitar in hand.         He's blinded
      by the lights and squints out at the audience.         He's frozen
      stiff.

      The crowd begins to murmur impatiently.         Miguel looks to
      H�ctor in the wing.

      H�ctor makes eye contact with Miguel and does the "loosen up"
      bone shimmy.

      On stage Miguel shakes off his nerves.       Deep exhale and...

</b><b>                  HAAAAAAAI-YAAAAAAAAAAAI-YAAAAAAAAI!

      The sound is full-throated and resonant. People in the
      audience whistle and whoop. Some return the grito, some
      applaud lightly. His brows go up and he begins his guitar
      intro.

<b>                            MIGUEL

      Once in the spotlight, H�ctor warms up and busts out some

      distance, he sees de la Cruz's tower. After only a few
      paces, Pepita lands in front of Miguel, cutting off his path!
      He skids to a stop.

<b>                               MIGUEL
</b><b>                  AAHH!
</b>
      Then, peeking over the jaguar's head is an even more
      terrifying sight: Mam� Imelda riding atop.

<b>                            MAM� IMELDA
</b>                  This nonsense ends now, Miguel! I
                  am giving you my blessing and you
                  are going home!

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  I don't want your blessing!

      Miguel scrambles upright and bounds for a narrow alley
      staircase.

<b>                             MAM� IMELDA
</b>                  Miguel!   Stop!

      Not able to get through on her spirit guide, Imelda is forced
      to pursue Miguel on foot.

      He wriggles through an iron gate.

<b>                            MAM� IMELDA (CONT'D)
</b>                  I am trying to save your life!

      She is stopped by the gate.

</b>                  You're ruining my life!

<b>                             MIGUEL
</b>                  Music's the only thing that makes

                      (beat)
                  You'll never understand.

      Miguel heads away from her up the stairs.

      Miguel stops in his tracks.      When Imelda finishes, he turns
      back, confused.

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  I thought you hated music.

<b>                            MAM� IMELDA
</b>                  Oh, I loved it.
                      (reminiscing)
                  I remember that feeling, when my
                  husband would play, and I would
                  sing and nothing else mattered.
                  But when we had Coco, suddenly...
                  there was something in my life that
                  mattered more than music. I wanted
                  to put down roots. He wanted to
                  play for the world.

      Mam� Imelda pauses for a moment, lost in a memory.

<b>                            MAM� IMELDA (CONT'D)
</b>                  We each made a sacrifice to get
                  what we wanted. Now you must make
                  a choice.

<b>                             MIGUEL

                  Why can't you be on MY side?
                  That's what family's supposed to do
                  -- support you.

</b>

      Miguel wipes the corner of his eye, frustrated. Imelda is
      shocked to see him so hurt, but Miguel turns away before she
      can answer and ascends the narrow staircase toward de la
      Cruz's tower.


<b>      EXT. BOTTOM OF THE TOWER
</b>
      Miguel arrives at the foot of the hill to de la Cruz's tower.

      Vehicles from all eras (limousines, motor cars, carriages)
      drop off finely dressed guests who line up to get aboard a
      funicular that scales the tower to the mansion.

      A couple at the front of the line show a fancy invitation to
      a SECURITY GUARD, who then lets them onto the funicular.

<b>                            SECURITY GUARD
</b>                  Have a good time.

<b>                            GUEST
</b>                  Oh, how exciting!

      EL SANTO, the silver-masked luchador, produces a fancy
      invitation to the security guard.

<b>                            SECURITY GUARD
</b>                  Oh!  El Santo!
                      (giddy)
                  I'm a big fan.

      The security guard sheepishly holds up a camera.

<b>                            SECURITY GUARD
</b>                  You mind if I--

      El Santo nods. The security guard removes his head and hands
      it to the luchador for a selfie. His body proceeds to take
      the photo.

<b>                            SECURITY GUARD
</b>                  Gracias, se�or!

      The security guard puts his head back on and El Santo heads
      past the velvet rope. Miguel is revealed waiting in line
      behind him.

<b>                            SECURITY GUARD
</b>                  Invitation?

      Miguel strikes de la Cruz's signature pose with his guitar.

      Miguel is tossed out of the line. Just then he sees Los
      Chachalacos unloading their instruments from their van. He
      runs up to them.

                  Congratulations chicos!

      Los Chachalacos file onto the funicular, the sousaphone
      player angling his instrument away from the security guard.
      After they get onto the funicular, he turns to reveal a pair
      of legs hanging out of the bell of the sousaphone. With a
      deep "TOOT!" Miguel spills out onto the floor of the
      funicular.

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  Thanks guys!

      The funicular ascends.

<b>      EXT. DE LA CRUZ'S MANSION

      The doors of the funicular open to reveal de la Cruz's lavish
      mansion. Los Chachalacos all file out.

      Miguel heads off toward the mansion.

      On the stairs leading up, the party is bustling --
      performers, servers and guests dressed to the nines.

      A fire breather lets out flames that transform into a flurry
      of butterflies.

<b>                            GUEST
</b>                  Look, it's Ernesto!

      Miguel catches a glimpse of de la Cruz heading deeper into
      the party. Miguel pursues.

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  De la Cruz...


<b>      INT. DE LA CRUZ'S MANSION

      Miguel heads into the foyer but loses de la Cruz in the
      crowd.

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  Se�or de la Cruz!

      Miguel elbows his way through the room.

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  Pardon me, Se�or de la Cruz!     Se�or
                  de la--

      He finds himself in a huge hall with hundreds of guests, the
      heart of the party. Film clips play all around the room from
      de la Cruz's movies.

<b>                            DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP)
</b>                  When you see your moment, you
                  mustn't let it pass you by. You
                  must seize it.

      Miguel takes it all in. Synchronized swimmers make
      formations in a sparkling indoor pool. A DJ lays a decades-
      spanning mash-up soundtrack.

      A clip of de la Cruz riding his noble steed plays behind
      Miguel.

<b>                            DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP)

      Miguel jumps to see above the crowd.

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  Se�or de la Cruz!     Se�or de la--

      Miguel is unable to get his great-great grandfather's
      attention. Meanwhile, a clip behind Miguel features de la
      Cruz as a good-natured priest:

<b>                            NUN (FILM CLIP)
</b>                  But what can we do? It is
                  hopeless...

<b>                            DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP)
</b>                  You must have faith, sister.

<b>                            NUN (FILM CLIP)

<b>                            DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP)
</b>                  He will listen... to MUSIC!

      The passionate words embolden Miguel. He climbs a pillar to
      the landing of a grand staircase, he stands above the crowd.

      Miguel takes a breath and throws out a grito as loud as he
      can. It echoes through the space, and party guests turn.
      The DJ fades the music.

      Garnering some attention, Miguel plays his guitar.   More
      guests turn.

      As a hush falls on the crowd, the sound of Miguel's guitar
      becomes singular.

<b>                            MIGUEL

      Miguel continues to play and sing as he nervously walks
      forward; the crowd parting, he moves closer to DLC.

      He passes a movie screen where a clip features de la Cruz
      singing the same song in one of his films, the songs
      overlapping for a brief moment.

      hero--

</b><b>                  FOR THIS MUSIC IS MY LANG--

      SPLASH!   Miguel tumbles into the indoor pool.

      The party-goers gasp, but it's Ernesto who rolls up his
      sleeves, and, in true movie hero fashion, jumps into the pool
      and lifts a coughing Miguel to the edge.

<b>                            DE LA CRUZ

      Miguel looks up, mortified. His painted face begins to run,
      revealing him to be a living boy. De la Cruz's eyes go wide.
      The crowd gasps and murmurs.

<b>                            DE LA CRUZ

      More murmuring from the crowd.       De la Cruz is shocked.

      Miguel takes in the room, it's almost too much to absorb.
      Something seems to be on the boy's mind.

      Miguel smiles, chest swelling.       He feels validated for the

      The hall has emptied, the lights are turned down. Bursts of
      color from outside flash across the walls. The only light
      coming from inside the hall are de la Cruz's film clips that
      continue to play on the walls.

      Miguel's chest swells. Then deflates. He lifts his shirt,
      revealing the skeletal transition partway up his torso.

      rises to his feet, hands defensively on Miguel's shoulders.

      They both drink.

      They walk down an empty street at night, H�ctor with suitcase
      and guitar case in tow. H�ctor stumbles, de la Cruz steadies
      him, takes his guitar case.

      A few more steps and H�ctor collapses in the street.      FADE TO

      H�ctor's suitcase is opened.       A hand reaches in to take the

      H�ctor clenches his jaw. Then he bounds at de la Cruz,
      tackling him to the ground.

<b>                             H�CTOR

</b>

<b>                            H�CTOR
</b>                  You took everything away from me!

      Security guards rush in to pull H�ctor off Ernesto.        H�ctor
      struggles, but it's no use.

<b>                              H�CTOR

      The guards drag H�ctor through a wide doorway.

</b>                  I just wanted to go back home!      No,
                  no, NO!

      The doors slam shut and cut off his shouts.         Miguel is left
      alone with de la Cruz.

<b>                            DE LA CRUZ

      De la Cruz pulls up a marigold petal, but hesitates.

<b>                            DE LA CRUZ
</b>                  Miguel, my reputation, it is very
                  important to me. I would hate to

<b>                            MIGUEL

                  the... the good guy.

      Doubt enters Miguel's mind. De la Cruz darkens, he places
      the photo of H�ctor in his coat pocket, gears turning in his
      mind.




<b>                                                                     97.

      De la Cruz crumples the marigold petal.

<b>                              DE LA CRUZ
</b>                  Security!

      De la Cruz's guards appear in the doorway.

<b>                            DE LA CRUZ (CONT'D)
</b>                  Take care of Miguel. He'll be
                  extending his stay.

      The guards grab Miguel by the shoulder.

<b>                              MIGUEL
</b>                  What?!    But I'm your family!

<b>                            DE LA CRUZ
</b>                  And H�ctor was my best friend.

      Miguel goes pale.

<b>                            DE LA CRUZ
</b>                  Success doesn't come     for free,

                  your moment. I know      you

      Miguel is dragged away.

<b>                              MIGUEL
</b>                  No, NO!


<b>      EXT. DE LA CRUZ'S TOWER
</b>
      The guards drag Miguel out the back of de la Cruz's mansion.

<b>                              MIGUEL
</b>                  Let go!

      They throw him into a cenote, an inescapable sinkhole behind
      the estate.


<b>      INT. CENOTE
</b>
<b>                             MIGUEL
</b><b>                  NO!   AHHHHHH!

</b>

      He falls four stories and splashes into the pool at the
      bottom of the hole. He breaks the surface and swims to a
      stone island in the center.

<b>                           MIGUEL
</b>                  Help! Can anyone hear me?        I wanna
                  go home!

      Miguel collapses on the stone island.

      His soaked hoodie sags off his shoulders.        The skeletal
      transition is almost complete.

      A moment of silence.     He is alone.

      Suddenly, Miguel hears a noise. Footsteps. H�ctor emerges
      from the darkness, looking beat up. H�ctor stumbles.

<b>                              MIGUEL
</b>                  H�ctor?

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  Oh, H�ctor!

      They run to each other.      H�ctor embraces Miguel.   But Miguel
      is overcome with shame.

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  You were right. I should have gone
                  back to my family--

      H�ctor tries to calm him but Miguel is shaking.

<b>                            H�CTOR
</b>                  Hey -- hey, hey...

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  They told me not to be like de la
                  Cruz, but I didn't listen--

<b>                            H�CTOR

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  I told them I didn't care if they
                  remembered me. I didn't care if I
                  was on their stupid ofrenda.

      H�ctor holds Miguel to his chest.       Miguel is tense.





<b>                                                                         99.

<b>                            H�CTOR
</b>                  Hey, chamaco, it's okay.         It's
                  okay.

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  I told them I didn't care.

      Suddenly, a golden flicker flutters through H�ctor's bones,
      and he falls to his knees.

<b>                              H�CTOR

      Miguel looks at H�ctor with concern.

<b>                              MIGUEL
</b>                  Who?

<b>                            H�CTOR

                  he loved her so much.
                      (beat)
                  My Coco...

      A chill runs through Miguel.

<b>                              MIGUEL
</b>                  Coco?

      Miguel reaches into his hoodie and pulls out the photo of
      Imelda, Coco, and the faceless musician.

      Miguel shows the photo to H�ctor.       H�ctor is confused; it's
      like he's seen a ghost.

<b>                             H�CTOR

<b>                             MIGUEL
</b>                   That's my Mam� Coco. That's my
                   Mam� Imelda. Is that... you?

      Gears turn in both of their heads.

      H�ctor is as shocked as Miguel.       He looks at his great-great
      grandson.

      He looks to the photo, touches the image of baby Coco, and he
      becomes saddened.

<b>                              H�CTOR

                   But she's the last person who
                   remembers me. The moment she's
                   gone from the living world...

      H�ctor is quiet for a moment.

<b>                             H�CTOR
</b>                   You know, I wrote her a song once.

                   apart we were. What I wouldn't

<b>                            MIGUEL (CONT'D)
</b>                  You should be the one the world
                  remembers, not de la Cruz!

<b>                            H�CTOR
</b>                  I didn't write "Remember Me" for
                  the world... I wrote it for Coco.
                  I'm a pretty sorry excuse for a
                  great-great grandpa.

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  Are you kidding? A minute ago I
                  thought I was related to a
                  murderer. You're a total upgrade!

      H�ctor doesn't smile.     Miguel kneels close.

<b>                             MIGUEL
</b>                  My whole life, there's been
                  something that made me different...
                  and I never knew where it came
                  from.
                      (beat)
                  But now I know. It comes from you.
                      (beat)
                  I'm proud we're family!

      Miguel looks up defiantly at the hole in the cenote.

<b>                            MIGUEL (CONT'D)
</b>                  I'm proud to be his family!
<b>                  TRRRRRAI-HAY-HAY-HAY-HAAAY!
</b>
      H�ctor perks up.

<b>                            H�CTOR
</b><b>                  TRRRRRRAAAAAI-HAAAI-HAAAAAY!
</b>                  I'm proud to be HIS family!

      They trade off their gritos until the cenote echoes with the
      sound. Soon though, the echoes fade. They're still stuck.
      Suddenly they hear a distant howling.

<b>                            DANTE (O.S)
</b>                  Rooo-rooo-roooooooo!

      Miguel and H�ctor look up.

<b>                              MIGUEL
</b>                  Dante?

<b>                            DANTE (O.S.)
</b>                      (louder)
                  Roooooo-roo-roo-rooo!




<b>                                                                     103.
</b>

      Up at the top of the cenote, Dante pokes his head in the
      opening.

<b>                              MIGUEL
</b>                  Dante!    It's Dante!

      Dante pants and wags his tail happily. Behind him Pepita
      peeks down through the hole and gives a powerful roar.
      Pepita's call shakes the cavern. She lowers her head to
      reveal Mam� Imelda riding atop her. Miguel and Mam� Imelda
      laugh with joy. Until her gaze falls upon H�ctor.

<b>                              H�CTOR
</b>                  Imelda!

<b>                              MAM� IMELDA
</b>                      (icy)
                  H�ctor.

<b>                            H�CTOR
</b>                  You look good...


<b>      EXT. CENOTE - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
      Pepita flies out of the cenote; Imelda, H�ctor, Miguel, and
      Dante ride on her back. She ascends above the clouds.


<b>      EXT. NIGHT SKY
</b>
      Miguel, wind in his hair, hugs Dante fiercely.

<b>                             MIGUEL
</b>                  Dante, you knew he was my Pap�
                  H�ctor the whole time! You ARE a
                  real spirit guide!
                       (doggy-praise)
                  Who's a good spirit guide? You
                  are!

      Dante smiles at Miguel dumbly. Suddenly, before Miguel's
      eyes, neon patterns spread outward from the dog's paws.
      Dante begins to freak out.

<b>                              MIGUEL
</b>                  Whoa...

      A pair of little wings sprout on the dog's back. He spreads
      them. He jumps up to fly... and plummets beneath the clouds!

<b>                              MIGUEL
</b>                  Dante!




<b>                                                                      104.
</b>

      But then he's back up, flapping goofily and barking his head
      off, a full-blown spirit guide!


<b>      EXT. SMALL PLAZA
</b>
      Pepita flies in, landing in a small plaza where the other
      Riveras wait.

<b>                            PAP� JULIO
</b>                  Look, there they are!

      The Dead Riveras come rushing up.

<b>                            FAMILY
</b>                  Miguel! / Miguelito! / Ay, gracias
                  a Dios! / It's Miguel! / He's all
                  right! / Oh thank goodness! /
                  Gracias, Dios m�o!

      They dismount from Pepita. H�ctor falls off first but gets
      up and raises his arm to help Imelda. She gives him a
      withering stare and dismounts without his help. Miguel pets
      Dante and Pepita gives Miguel a big lick.

      Imelda rounds Pepita's shoulder and folds Miguel into a tight
      hug.

<b>                            MAM� IMELDA
</b>                  Mijo, I was so worried! Thank
                  goodness we found you in time!

      Imelda's eyes fall on H�ctor, who holds his hat in his hands
      sheepishly.

<b>                            MAM� IMELDA
</b>                  And you! How many times must I
                  turn you away?

<b>                              H�CTOR
</b>                  Imelda--

<b>                             MAM� IMELDA
</b>                  I want nothing to do with you. Not
                  in life, not in death!
                      (beat)
                  I spent decades protecting my
                  family from your mistakes. He
                  spends five minutes with you and I
                  have to fish him out of a sinkhole!

      Miguel steps between Imelda and H�ctor.





<b>                                                                      105.
</b>

<b>                             MIGUEL
</b>                  I wasn't in there `cause of H�ctor.
                  He was in there `cause of me.
                      (beat)
                  He was just trying to get me
                  home... I didn't wanna listen, but
                  he was right... nothing is more
                  important than family.

      Mam� Imelda looks at H�ctor, shocked to hear the sentiment.

<b>                            MIGUEL (CONT'D)
</b>                  I'm ready to accept your
                  blessing... and your conditions.
                  But first, I need to find de la
                  Cruz. To get H�ctor's photo.

<b>                              MAM� IMELDA
</b>                  What?

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  So he can see Coco again.        H�ctor
                  should be on our ofrenda.        He's
                  part of our family--

<b>                            MAM� IMELDA
</b>                  He left this family!

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  He tried to go home to you and
                  Coco... but de la Cruz murdered
                  him!

      Startled, she looks to H�ctor for confirmation.

<b>                            H�CTOR
</b>                  It's true, Imelda.

      Imelda wrestles with her emotions.

<b>                            MAM� IMELDA
</b>                  And so what if it's true? You
                  leave me alone with a child to
                  raise and I'm just supposed to
                  forgive you?

<b>                            H�CTOR
</b>                  Imelda, I--

      H�ctor's body suddenly shimmers, leaving him winded.   Imelda
      gasps.





<b>                                                               106.
</b>

<b>                              MIGUEL

<b>                            H�CTOR

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  You don't have to forgive him...
                  But we shouldn't forget him.

<b>                            MAM� IMELDA
</b>                      (to H�ctor)
                  I wanted to forget you. I wanted
                  Coco to forget you too, but--

<b>                             H�CTOR
</b>                  This is my fault, not yours.
                      (beat)
                  I'm sorry, Imelda.

      Mam� Imelda, holding in her emotions, turns to Miguel.

<b>                            MAM� IMELDA
</b>                  Miguel, if we help you get his

                  more music?

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  Family comes first.

      Mam� Imelda considers.      She turns to H�ctor.

<b>                            MAM� IMELDA
</b>                  I -- I can't forgive you.        But I

      Miguel smiles.

<b>                            MAM� IMELDA
</b>                      (to Miguel)
                  So how do we get to de la Cruz?

      Miguel furrows his brow.

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  I might know a way...





<b>                                                                       107.
</b>

<b>      EXT. SUNRISE SPECTACULAR AMPHITHEATER - BEFORE DAWN
</b>
      Crowds are congregated at de la Cruz's Sunrise Spectacular
      which takes place in an open air amphitheater. They hurry to
      their seats as the lights begin to dim.


<b>      ON STAGE
</b>
      Frida's performance piece begins. Dramatic symphonic music
      plays as a giant papaya appears to ignite on stage. The
      "seeds" in the body of the papaya unfurl to reveal that they
      are dancers, each dressed like Frida Kahlo, right down to the
      painted on unibrow.

      The dancers roll out of the "flaming" papaya and gyrate their
      bodies nonsensically.

      A giant cactus that resembles Frida is illuminated, and all
      the dancers slink to it.

      In the midst of this, eight familiar looking dancers (the
      Dead Riveras and Miguel) inch their way out of the spotlights
      and to the wings of the stage.


<b>      STAGE WING
</b>
<b>                             FRIDA
</b>                   Good luck, muchacho.

<b>                             MIGUEL
</b>                   Gracias Frida!


<b>      INT. BACKSTAGE CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
      The Dead Riveras congregate in a hidden backstage corridor,
      shedding their Frida outfits. Miguel rips off his unibrow.

<b>                              MIGUEL
</b>                   Ow!

      Dante has snuck in under T�o Oscar's skirt.   H�ctor sees that
      Imelda is tangled up in her outfit.

<b>                             H�CTOR

</b>                   Don't touch me.

      The family joins together in a huddle.




<b>                                                                       108.

<b>                            H�CTOR
</b>                  Got your petals?

      Each family member raises a marigold petal.   Imelda leads the
      way out of the corridor.

<b>                            MAM� IMELDA
</b>                  Now, we just have to find de la
                  Cruz--

      Right around the corner is de la Cruz who turns with a smile.

<b>                              DE LA CRUZ
</b>                  Yes?

<b>                              MAM� IMELDA
</b>                  Ah!

      The family stops in their tracks, still hidden from de la
      Cruz's view. It's just him and Imelda. His smile drops.

<b>                            DE LA CRUZ
</b>                  Don't I know you?

      Imelda pulls off her shoe and slaps de la Cruz across the
      face with it.

<b>                            MAM� IMELDA
</b>                  That's for murdering the love of my

      H�ctor leaps out from around the corner.

<b>                            H�CTOR

</b>

<b>                            MAM� IMELDA
</b>                  I don't know! I'm still angry at

<b>                              DE LA CRUZ
</b>                  H�ctor?!    How did you--

      Imelda slaps de la Cruz again.

<b>                            MAM� IMELDA
</b>                  And that's for trying to murder my

<b>                               DE LA CRUZ
</b>                  Grandson?

      Now Miguel leaps out of the corridor.

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  She's talking about me!

      De la Cruz sees the three of them and puts the pieces
      together.

<b>                           DE LA CRUZ
</b>                  You! Wait, you're related to
                  H�ctor?

      Miguel sees the photo in de la Cruz's pocket.

<b>                               MIGUEL
</b>                  The photo!

      The rest of the Riveras emerge from the corridor.
      Outnumbered, de la Cruz turns and runs.

<b>                               MAM� IMELDA
</b>                  After him!

      De la Cruz knocks over a group of giant sugar skull dancers.
      He emerges at a full sprint to where his rising platform is
      set up.

<b>                               DE LA CRUZ
</b>                  Security!     Ay�denme!

      The Riveras flood out after him.        H�ctor jogs next to Imelda.

<b>                            H�CTOR
</b>                  You said "love of your life..."

<b>                            MAM� IMELDA
</b>                  I don't know WHAT I said!

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  That's what I heard...

      A brawl ensues between the family and the guards.

      De la Cruz runs to a stage door.

<b>                            STAGEHAND
</b>                  Places, se�or, you're on in 30
                  seconds!

      De la Cruz shoves the stagehand out of the way.

      As security guards try to wrangle the Riveras, Imelda reaches
      de la Cruz and gets her hands on H�ctor's photo. De la Cruz
      scuffles with her to get it back, when Miguel tackles de la
      Cruz to the ground. De la Cruz loses his grip; Imelda
      tumbles backward, photo in hand.

<b>                             MAM� IMELDA
</b>                  Miguel!   I have it!

      Miguel turns toward Imelda but is chased by guards.

      Suddenly, Imelda rises into the air. She is on de la Cruz's
      rising platform! She is lifted through the ceiling and up to
      the stage.

      De la Cruz hurries up the stairs after her.

      Miguel is detained by a security guard when Dante flies in
      and knocks the guard's head clean off. Miguel, H�ctor, T�a
      Victoria, and T�a Rosita hurry up the stairs after de la
      Cruz.

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  Hurry, come on!

      Pap� Julio, T�o Oscar, and T�o Felipe block the guards from
      following the others.

      The platform rises onto the stage and the spotlight falls on
      Imelda. Neon letters blast brightly behind her, spelling
      "ERNESTO!" The audience bursts into applause!

<b>                              CROWD MEMBER
</b>                  Nesto!

      Imelda appears onscreen for all to see.


<b>      STAGE WING RIGHT
</b>
      De la Cruz rushes up a staircase and arrives in the wings.
      He gets the attention of his guards and points to Imelda.

<b>                            DE LA CRUZ
</b>                  Get her off the stage!

      His guards hustle onto the stage, scaling the set to get to
      her.


<b>      STAGE WING LEFT
</b>
      Miguel, H�ctor, Victoria, and Rosita emerge to see Imelda
      spotlit above them.


<b>      ON STAGE
</b>
      De la Cruz's guards begin to approach Imelda.   She is frozen,
      unable to move.

<b>                              MIGUEL (O.S.)

      Mam� Imelda looks down and sees Miguel in the wing.

<b>                              MIGUEL (CONT'D)
</b><b>                  SING!

      Imelda, seeing that the guards are approaching, closes her
      eyes, grasps the mic, and follows Miguel's instructions.

<b>                            MAM� IMELDA

<b>      STAGE WING LEFT
</b>
      H�ctor's mouth gapes open.      T�a Victoria and T�a Rosita go
      wide-eyed.

      Miguel sets H�ctor up with a guitar, then adjusts a mic stand
      in front of him. H�ctor plays the guitar, its sound
      amplified through the stage speakers.


<b>      ON STAGE

</b>
      The guards reach the edge of her spotlight but stop short,
      not wanting to interrupt the performance.

      Imelda takes the spotlight with her as she descends the on
      stage staircase. As she comes down, she makes eye contact
      with her husband in the wing. He smiles as he accompanies
      her. Imelda's eyes glint, touched to see him supporting her.

<b>                            MAM� IMELDA
</b><b>                  Y AUNQUE LA VIDA ME CUESTE, LLORONA,

</b><b>                  NO DEJAR� DE QUERERTE!
</b>
      As H�ctor accompanies Imelda, she becomes more confident.
      The audience begins to clap.

      De la Cruz grunts in frustration.

      Soon, the stage conductor joins with more instrumentation,
      which kicks into high gear.

<b>                            MAM� IMELDA
</b><b>                  ME SUB� AL PINO M�S ALTO, LLORONA,
</b><b>                  A VER SI TE DIVISABA.
</b>
      She doubles down on her performance, taking the spotlight
      with her as she moves to put distance between her and the
      guards.

      Imelda continues to vamp, trying to navigate away from the
      guards and toward her family. One guard blocks her way, but
      she grabs him and forces him to dance. Scared of the
      spotlight, he runs away.

<b>                            MAM� IMELDA

      She heads to leave the stage when she is stopped by a hand on
      her wrist. A voice joins her in harmony, the spotlight
      widens to reveal Ernesto de la Cruz singing too. The crowd
      goes wild.

      He dances Imelda around the stage, all the while trying to
      get to H�ctor's photo.

</b>
      At the finale of the song, Imelda stomps her heel into de la
      Cruz's foot on his high note, causing him to let her go. She
      runs off stage with the photo.


<b>      BACKSTAGE
</b>
      Imelda arrives off stage and, somewhat high on adrenaline,
      she embraces H�ctor.

<b>                            MAM� IMELDA
</b>                  I forgot what that felt like.

      H�ctor is taken by surprise. Imelda, realizing the
      impropriety, pulls away from him awkwardly.

<b>                            H�CTOR
</b>                  You... still got it.

      They smile at each other, softening.         Miguel, off to the
      side, clears his throat.

      Imelda, now reminded, gives Miguel the photo.         She pulls out
      her petal.

<b>                            MAM� IMELDA
</b>                  Miguel, I give you my blessing.

      The petal glows.

      Miguel looks slightly saddened, anticipating the condition.

      Imelda smiles.

</b>                  To never... forget how much your

      The petal surges.      Miguel brightens, touched.

      Suddenly Miguel is yanked away from his great-great
      grandparents by de la Cruz. De la Cruz has grabbed Miguel by
      the scruff of his hoodie.

      Imelda lunges at de la Cruz, but he pushes her to the floor.

      Dante growls and tries to grab Miguel.

      De la Cruz pulls Miguel away, closer to the ledge of the
      building.

      H�ctor struggles but continues pursuing de la Cruz.

      H�ctor stumbles, shimmering like before.        He falls to the
      ground.

      In the stage wings, T�a Rosita commandeers one of the cameras
      and points it toward de la Cruz. T�a Victoria sidles up to a
      control board and pushes a volume dial up.

      Miguel is in free fall, the photo still in his hand. As the

      Dante slices downward through the air, catches Miguel's shirt
      in his teeth, and opens his wings. He and Miguel jerk
      upward, but the photo falls from Miguel's hands and is gone
      from sight.

      Miguel and Dante twist in the air, Dante trying to slow their
      decent but the two of them are too heavy. Miguel's shirt
      rips and Dante loses him.

      Miguel plummets toward the base of the tower. Suddenly
      Pepita flies in and scoops up Miguel. Dante follows close
      behind. Miguel looks over the side of Pepita down towards
      the water.

      More booing.    De la Cruz tries to kick up the orchestra.

      The crowd pelts de la Cruz with fruit and offerings.

<b>                               CROWD MEMBER
</b>                  Look!

      Crowd members point up to the screen. Pepita rises above the
      ledge with Miguel on her back. Miguel slides off her wing
      and runs to his family.

<b>                            CROWD MEMBER
</b>                  He's alright!

      The crowd cheers.     There are sighs of relief.

      De la Cruz, seeing this     play out on screen, realizes his
      backstage treachery has     been projected to the whole world.
      He watches horrified as     the image of Pepita grows larger and
      larger on the screen as     she prowls past the camera.

      De la Cruz begins to back up just as Pepita emerges through
      the curtain, eyes locked on him.

<b>                             DE LA CRUZ
</b>                   Nice kitty...

      Suddenly Pepita head-butts de la Cruz and lifts him into the
      sky, flinging the singer in the air like a kitten playing
      with a ball of yarn.

<b>                             DE LA CRUZ
</b>                   AAAHHHH! Put me down! No, please!
                   I beg of you, stop! Stop! NO!

      She swings him around to gain momentum, then throws him over
      the audience.

</b><b>                   NO!   AAAHHH!

      He flies out of the stadium, hitting a giant church bell in
      the distance. The stadium erupts in cheers.

      In the midst of the cheering, an unsuspecting crowd member
      returns from concessions.

<b>                             CROWD MEMBER

<b>      BACK STAGE
</b>
      Miguel is surrounded by family, safe.        He hugs Dante.

</b>                   Good boy, Dante.

</b>                   Miguel!

      Behind them, H�ctor struggles to get to his feet but stumbles
      with a flicker. Miguel runs to support him.

<b>                              MIGUEL

      Suddenly H�ctor suffers his most violent flickering yet.      He
      collapses. Miguel kneels by him.

<b>                              MIGUEL

<b>                             MIGUEL
</b>                  No!   We can still find the photo...

      Mam� Imelda looks to the horizon, the first rays of sunlight
      peeking over.

<b>                            MAM� IMELDA
</b>                  Miguel, it's almost sunrise!

                  promised I'd put your photo up. I
                  promised you'd see Coco!

      H�ctor looks at Miguel. The skeletal transformation is
      creeping in on the edges of Miguel's face. He's almost full
      skeleton now.

<b>                            H�CTOR
</b>                  We're both out of time, mijo.

      The shimmering of H�ctor's bones advances.

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  No, no... she can't forget you!

<b>                             H�CTOR
</b>                  I just wanted her to know that I
                  loved her.

      H�ctor musters the strength to grab the marigold petal.

<b>                              MIGUEL
</b>                  H�ctor--

<b>                            MAM� IMELDA
</b>                  No conditions.

      The petal glows.

      H�ctor struggles to lift the petal to Miguel.      Mam� Imelda
      takes his hand in hers.

<b>                             MIGUEL
</b>                   No, Pap� H�ctor, please!

      Imelda and H�ctor move their joined hands toward Miguel's
      chest.

<b>                                MIGUEL
</b>                   No...

      H�ctor's eyelids begin to close.

      goes white.

<b>                                                   FADE IN:
</b>

<b>      INT. DE LA CRUZ'S MAUSOLEUM - SUNRISE
</b>
      Miguel finds himself back in de la Cruz's tomb.

      Dazed, he looks through the windows; day has broken.

      On the floor is the skull guitar. Miguel grabs it.      He exits
      the tomb and takes off out of the cemetery.

<b>      EXT. PLAZA
</b>
      Miguel races through the plaza, past the statue of de la
      Cruz.

      Miguel races through the streets towards home. He blows
      right past his T�o Berto snoring and Primo Abel sleeping on a
      bench.

<b>                             T�O BERTO
</b>                       (jolting awake)
                   There he is!

      Abel falls off the bench.

      Pap� comes from around a corner as Miguel is running.

<b>                              PAP�
</b>                   Miguel!?   Stop!

</b>

<b>      EXT. RIVERA COMPOUND
</b>
      Miguel rounds the corner and follows the trail of marigolds
      through the front gate.

      He runs for Mam� Coco's bedroom. Just as he makes it to the
      doorway, Abuelita steps up and blocks him.

<b>                            ABUELITA
</b>                  Where have you been?!

<b>                           MIGUEL
</b>                  Ah! I need to see Mam� Coco,
                  please--

      Abuelita spies the guitar in Miguel's hand.

<b>                            ABUELITA
</b>                  What are you doing with that?     Give
                  it to me!

      Miguel pushes past Abuelita, and slams the door shut.

<b>                             ABUELITA
</b>                  Miguel!   Stop! Miguel!      Miguel!
                  Miguel!   MIGUEL!


<b>      INT. MAM� COCO'S ROOM
</b>
      Miguel locks the door and goes up to Mam� Coco.      She stares
      into space, eyes completely vacant.

<b>                               MIGUEL
</b>                  Mam� Coco?     Can you hear me?   It's
                  Miguel.

      Miguel looks into her eyes.

<b>                            MIGUEL (CONT'D)
</b>                  I saw your pap�. Remember? Pap�?
                  Please -- if you forget him, he'll
                  be gone... forever!

      She doesn't respond.      Miguel's father bangs on the door.

<b>                            PAP� (O.S.)
</b>                  Miguel, open this door!

      Miguel shows her the guitar.





<b>                                                                        123.
</b>

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  Here -- this was his guitar, right?
                  He used to play it to you? See,
                  there he is.

      Still nothing.    Her eyes are glazed.

<b>                            MIGUEL (CONT'D)
</b>                  Pap�, remember? Pap�?

      Mam� Coco stares forward, as if Miguel isn't even there.

<b>                              PAP� (O.S.)
</b>                  Miguel!

</b>                  Mam� Coco, please, don't forget
                  him.

      With a rattle of keys, the door flies open.    The family pours
      in.

<b>                            ABUELITA
</b>                  What are you doing to that poor
                  woman?

      Abuelita brushes Miguel aside to comfort her mother.

<b>                            ABUELITA
</b>                  It's okay, Mamita, it's okay.

<b>                            PAP�
</b>                  What's gotten into you?

      Miguel looks down, defeated. Tears drip off his nose.
      Pap�'s anger gives way to relief. He embraces his son.

<b>                            PAP�
</b>                  I thought I'd lost you, Migue...

      Mam� steps forward.

</b>                  We're all together now, that's what

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  Not all of us...

      Abuelita returns from consoling Mam� Coco.




<b>                                                                      124.

<b>                             ABUELITA

                  Miguel, you apologize to your Mam�
                  Coco!

      Miguel looks at Mam� Coco and approaches her.

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  Mam� Coco...

      His toe accidentally taps against H�ctor's skull guitar, a
      soft hollow ringing resonates.

<b>                             ABUELITA
</b>                  Well?   Apologize.

      He comes to a realization.

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  Mam� Coco? Your pap� -- he wanted
                  you to have this.

      He picks up the guitar. Abuelita steps forward to intervene
      but Pap� places a hand on her shoulder.

<b>                            PAP�
</b>                  Mam�, wait--

      Miguel starts to sing "Remember Me" the way H�ctor sang it...
      softly, from the heart.

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                      (singing)

<b>                              MAM�
</b>                  Look...

      The glimmer in the Mam� Coco's eyes grows brighter with every
      note. Memories flood in, filling the vacancy of her
      expression with life. Her cheeks soften and plump. Her lips
      arc into a smile.

<b>                            MIGUEL

</b>
      Miguel sings gently, with love.

      Mam� Coco's brows slope up, delighted.          The song seems to
      bring her back to life.

      Abuelita can't speak.     None of them can.

      Brimming, Mam� Coco joins Miguel in song -- her voice
      scratchy with age, his clear with youth.

<b>                MAMA COCO                              MIGUEL

</b>
      Tears stream down Abuelita's face; she's witnessing a
      miracle.

      Mam� Coco looks to her daughter, and is troubled by her
      tears.

<b>                             MAM� COCO
</b>                  Elena?   What's wrong, mija?

<b>                            ABUELITA
</b>                  Nothing Mam�. Nothing at all.

      Mam� Coco turns to Miguel.

<b>                            MAM� COCO
</b>                  My pap� used to sing me that song.

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  He loved you, Mam� Coco.         Your pap�
                  loved you so much.

      A smile spreads across Mam� Coco's face.          She's waited a long
      time to hear those words.

      She turns to her nightstand, hand shaking.          She opens a
      drawer and pulls out a notebook.

<b>                            MAM� COCO
</b>                  I kept... his letters... poems he
                  wrote me... and...

</b>

      Mam� Coco leafs through the book to reveal a torn scrap of
      paper. She hands it to Miguel. It's the missing face from
      the photo -- H�ctor's face.

      Miguel pieces the picture back together, finally seeing
      H�ctor as he was in life, a young, handsome man.

      Mam� Coco smiles. She finds the words slowly, but she speaks
      with fondness and love.

<b>                            MAM� COCO

      The family gathers close to listen.

      head stones and laying flowers.


<b>      EXT. DE LA CRUZ'S MAUSOLEUM
</b>
      Not as many offerings this year, not as many fans. No
      mariachi band. Someone has hung a sign "FORGET YOU" on the
      bust of de la Cruz.

<b>      EXT. RIVERA WORKSHOP
</b>
      The tour guide stands in front of the Rivera shoe shop.
      Tourists crowd in, taking pictures of the skull guitar and
      framed letters H�ctor wrote to Coco.

                  contain the lyrics for all of your

<b>      EXT. COURTYARD
</b>
      We travel through the courtyard catching glimpses of holiday
      preparation. Prima Rosa and primo Abel hang papel picado.
      Pap� and Mam� work on tamales. T�o Berto sweeps the
      cobblestones as the little cousins play.

<b>                            MIGUEL (O.S.)
</b>                  And that man is your Pap� Julio...

<b>      INT. OFRENDA ROOM
</b>
      Miguel holds his baby sister SOCORRO (10 months) in his arms
      and points out all of the family members.

<b>                            MIGUEL (CONT'D)
</b>                  ...And there's T�a Rosita... and
                  your T�a Victoria... and those two
                  are Oscar and Felipe. These aren't
                  just old pictures -- they're our
                  family -- and they're counting on
                  us to remember them.

      Abuelita approaches and smiles to see her grandson passing on
      the tradition. Then she places a picture frame on the
      ofrenda, a photo of Mam� Coco. She looks to Miguel who puts
      his arm around her.

      Next to Mam� Coco's picture sits the photo of Mam� Imelda and
      H�ctor, taped back together. Restored.

      H�ctor steps up to the monitor. The agent recognizes him.
      H�ctor chuckles nervously. The monitor scans him. DING!

</b><b>                  THAT I DREAMED ABOUT YOU
</b>
      H�ctor's chest swells.

<b>      EXT. FOOT OF THE BRIDGE
</b>
      H�ctor exits from the Marigold Grand Central Station. Mam�
      Imelda waits on the cobblestones to greet him. They kiss.
      Then he hears a familiar voice.

<b>                              MAM� COCO
</b>                  Pap�!

      H�ctor turns to see his daughter approaching.   He opens his
      arms to give Coco the biggest hug.

<b>                              H�CTOR
</b>                  Coco!

</b>
      Every moment together is a miracle and he holds Coco like he
      knows it. Soon Coco, H�ctor, and Imelda join hands. The
      petals of the bridge glow as they step forward. The family
      crosses together.

      Dante and Pepita fly through the night sky in the Land of the
      Dead. They alight on the marigold path and bound across into
      the Land of the Living.

<b>      EXT. STREETS OF SANTA CECILIA

      Dante's shadow is cast against a wall. When he rounds the
      corner, he is just a normal xolo dog, no wings or vibrant
      colors. Pepita's shadow looms large, but as she rounds the
      corner it shrinks to reveal that she is a little alley cat in
      the Land of the Living.


<b>      EXT. RIVERA COURTYARD
</b>
      They enter the Rivera compound. Abuelita greets Dante and
      tosses him a sweet treat. In the courtyard, the family is
      gathered as Miguel plays his guitar and sings. Dante hops up
      to give him a lick on the cheek.

      Amongst the living Riveras are the spirits of their loved
      ones, T�a Rosita, T�a Victoria, Pap� Julio, T�o Oscar and T�o
      Felipe, all present and enjoying the reunion.

      Abel and Rosa accompany Miguel with instruments of their own.
      Pap� cradles Miguel's new baby sister as Mam� leans on his
      shoulder. Abuelita listens proudly to her grandchildren
      while the spirit of Mam� Coco stands beside, arm around her
      shoulder.

      The courtyard is full of Riveras, living and dead. H�ctor
      and Imelda stand arm in arm, listening to Miguel play. As
      Miguel sings, the whole family, living and dead, all sing,
      play and enjoy the music.

      The whole family, brought together by a song.
